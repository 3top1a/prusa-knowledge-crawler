# [De-lamination / separated layers (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/de-lamination-separated-layers-sl1-sl1s_3)

If you encounter de-lamination, separated layers, or missing layers, the cause is usually in a broken SL1/STL file. Another cause can be a faulty UV LED panel or dirt in the resin tank.

Note that this is a different case than a

[lack of supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/missing-parts-sl1-sl1s_1794)

, where entire parts of the print can be missing.

If you start a print that consumes more resin than the tank's capacity, you should refill resin right away when being prompted (max 3-5 minutes). This is to avoid artifacts and potential de-lamination. If possible use the hollowing feature in your slicer.

### **Solution:**

* Try printing a pre-sliced sample object from the [Prusa driver's package](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) and see if the issue persists. If it does, clean the resin tank properly and try again.
* Continuous issues with separated/missing layers can be caused by a faulty UV LED panel – check whether it works correctly by removing the tank and initiating the Display test. Navigate the menu to _Settings - > Advanced settings -> UV & Display settings -> Display Test **.** Follow the on-screen instructions and inspect the logo through the orange cover through your smartphone or camera._



**WARNING: DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY INTO THE UV LED, while it is TURNED ON!**

Even though the orange cover provides some protection if you want to check the LED panel look at it through your phone camera app or take a photo so you won't look directly into the light.

* If the tank and UV LED-panel checks out, the cause is most likely a [broken object file (3d model)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/corrupted-3d-models-for-printing_2205). Either try re-slicing the model or download a new one.

# [Flashing custom firmware MINI](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flashing-custom-firmware-mini_14)

Every firmware version goes through intense testing to verify that every single feature works as it should. That applies especially to the safety features: for example, if the thermistor readings are outside the limits, the heating stops automatically.

We cannot guarantee the functionality of the safety features in a community-made or custom-modified firmware.

Official firmware is **signed with a private key** and the printer verifies the validity of this signature before it allows a firmware update.

To flash your own (or a community-made) unsigned firmware, you’ll have to **break** the appendix on the logic board (called the Buddy board) and move the jumper in a correct position. Breaking the appendix on the Buddy board is irreversible and voids the warranty of your printer’s electronics.

1. Turn off and unplug the printer.
2. Pull out the power switch to access the appendix (1).
3. Take a small thin screwdriver, insert it into the long hole furthest from the wall of the case, and carefully remove the middle part.


3. Check the three pins above it - there must be a black jumper on the two pins that are closer to the center of the board.



**Some revisions of the board will only have two pins for the jumper. You will then not need the jumper at all!** Only break the appendix to flash unsigned firmware. A jumper on these pins can even prohibit the firmware from being updated.

If you break the appendix, you void your warranty and we

**disclaim responsibility**

for any possible damage done to the printer and/or its surroundings (e.g. in case of a fire).

# [Infill](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42)

The main purpose of infill is to provide internal support for top layers, which would otherwise have to bridge over empty space. Infill also affects the speed of printing, structural strength, filament consumption, and even the look of the printed object.

Some options will only appear when

[Expert mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

is selected.

### Fill density

Most models can be printed with 10-15% infill. If the top of the model closes gradually, it can be printed hollow (0% infill), though we generally do not recommend it. If you need the model to be heavier, want more compression resistance or higher stiffness, you can increase the infill. You'll rarely need infill higher than 30%. Finally, you can print the model with 100% infill and the infill pattern will be forced to rectilinear. Keep in mind that 100% infill can have a negative impact on the look of the printed object.

**Increasing model strength**

The strength of a model is mostly defined by the number of

**perimeters (not infill**

). If you want to have a stronger print, increase the number of perimeters. That said, infill does help with compression resistance.

### Fill pattern

PrusaSlicer offers many infill patterns to choose from - check the dedicated [**Infill pattern documentation page**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill-patterns_177130).

### Length of the infill anchor

The infill is usually **connected to the perimeters** with a so-called anchor, which is a **short line** of another (inner) perimeter that turns into an infill line. This makes the infill sturdier and is required by some materials (namely PETG) to stabilize the extrusion flow at the start of an infill line.

The length of the infill anchor value sets how many millimeters of this anchor will connect the infill and the perimeters. If you set this value to 0, the infill will be printed independently on the perimeters. Set a higher value to print the anchor that will continue as the infill itself.

If expressed as a percentage (15%) it will be calculated over the infill extrusion width.

### Maximum length of the infill anchor

This value sets the maximum length of the infill anchor connecting the infill with perimeters.

Set this parameter to 0 to disable anchoring completely.

### Top fill pattern

You can pick a custom infill pattern that only affects the top visible layer, not adjacent solid layers below.

### Bottom fill pattern

You can pick a custom infill pattern that only affects the bottom visible layer, not adjacent solid layers above.

### Combine infill every X layers

Different layer heights will be used for infill and for perimeters in order to speed up the print without sacrificing the print quality.
Example: Combine infill every 3 layers, layer height 0.1 mm, infill will be printed at 0.3 mm layer height.

The maximum layer height is limited by your nozzle diameter. If you try to combine infill every 1+ layers with 0.4 mm nozzle and 0.3 mm layer height, no change will actually happen because you cannot print layers bigger than (about) 0.32mm (80% of nozzle diameter).

_Infill (grey) printed at double the layer height of perimeters (orange)_

### Only infill where needed

This option will make infill behave like an internal support structure, only areas that need support will generate an infill pattern below them. If enabled it slows down the G-code generation (due to extra overhang test involved). Furthermore, infill will likely become disconnected from the perimeters in some areas, so use this option with caution.

_Sphere with Infill only where needed is enabled_

### Solid Infill every X layers

This feature allows you to force a solid layer after every given number of layers. This can be useful to increase the strength of the printed part, however other options, such as increasing the number of perimeters or infill percentage are preferred. Another application would be to create separate internal cells in order to increase thermal insulation.

### Fill angle

Default angle for infill orientation. Cross-hatching will be applied to some infill patterns.

**Bridges** will be printed using the best direction PrusaSlicer can detect, so this setting does not affect them.

### Solid infill threshold area

Force solid infill for regions having a smaller area than the specified threshold.

_Solid infill threshold 0 (left), 15 (middle), 100 (right)_

# [Scratches/bubbles on prints (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/scratches-bubbles-on-prints-sl1-sl1s_1424)

Bubbles or small scratches (also appearing like cracks) on the object are caused by small pieces of dirt or debris in the tank (vat) you are using. These small objects travel in the tank during printing, creating paths that resemble scratches as they move.

Make sure that the resin is 100% pure and free of small dirt particles. Filter the contaminated resin, for example, through a coffee filter. Also make sure your print tray is 100% clean and there are no dirt particles on the FEP film. Rinse the tank in warm water and then dry it with a paper towel.

---

# [Holes in print (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/holes-in-print-sl1-sl1s_1437)

Large holes (defects) in printed objects are almost **exclusively caused by dirt on the FEP foil or loose particles in the resin**. Tiny pieces of debris on the bottom of the tank will block the light from reaching the resin correctly. Dirt particles also have a tendency to grow during the print, which will increase the size of the hole through the course of the print.

Make sure the FEP foil on the bottom of the tank is perfectly clean. Empty the tank of resin, filtering it with the sieve to make sure any hard particles are not poured back into its bottle. Carefully remove any dirt / solidified bits.

If the FEP foil is cloudy, use hot water and dishwashing soap to clean and restore the original look. The FEP film is rated for 10 prints, but will most often last you longer than that.

If you need to replace the FEP film, the printer comes with spares and it can also be found in our eshop for the

[SL1](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/fep-film-3-pcs-sl1/)

and for the

# [Object missing details](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/object-missing-details_1468)

The Original Prusa SL1 3D printer can produce objects with an incredible amount of detail – tiny wrinkles on cloth of a figure, texture of skin, thin railings on buildings, etc. However, in case the printed object is missing small details (not entire parts of the model), it can be due to incorrect exposure times.

Make sure you are using the correct preset for your color/resin in PrusaSlicer!

#### **Insufficient exposure**

Too short exposure times will result in details being “melted” together. Increase the exposure times to recommended values to fix this issue.

#### **Overexposed layers**

Long exposure times will result in a “staircase” effect – the layers won’t blend into each other perfectly and some details may be lost due to this effect. Use the recommended exposure time values to fix this issue.

# [Geometrically precise objects](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/geometrically-precise-objects_1507)

Mechanical parts, objects that should fit together, joints, pegs, and similar things need to be printed precisely. While SLA 3D printers are more suitable for printing organic shapes, geometric shapes and assembly parts can be printed as well. The key here is to **place supports strategically along the edges of the object**.

The reason is simple: when printing with liquid resins, the cured material is still relatively soft, which means that **the object can bend very slightly** during platform movements. Also, **most resins have a tendency to shrink** a little bit after being cured by UV light, which can result in slightly warped edges of the printed object. Again, a good number of supports is key.

_When printing non-organic shapes, use the manual support placement tool to place thicker supports along the edges of the object_

Also, remember, when printing objects directly on the platform, the first few layers will usually develop something we call an ‘ **elephant foot** ’ – as the first layers are cured, the material will expand a little bit, creating an uneven surface. This is why **using the Pad is recommended**.

As already mentioned, the print will always take the same amount of time no matter how many objects there are on the print platform. The total time is defined by the number of layers to solidify. Use this to your advantage: if you have a complex object with tricky orientation, place multiple copies on the print platform and rotate each object in a different direction. This will help you to save time.

_Print the object in various rotations at the same time to quickly find the optimal orientation – the printing time will remain the same_

# [Tree supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tree-supports_1515)

Unlike FDM supports, which are usually lattice or grid-like, SLA supports are **scaffolding tree-like structures with very thin tips**. They’re easy to remove and they leave little to no traces on the printed object’s surface when removed. This also means that an insufficient number of supports can lead to unwanted effects – e.g. heavy objects can detach during the print. Supports go hand in hand with object orientation – by rotating the object to an optimal position, you can minimize the need for supports.

You can get rid of tons of supports if you rotate the object to an optimal position. Teeth on this T-rex head can be printed without supports

Also, keep in mind that removing the supports can leave tiny marks on the surface, so if your object has certain areas that should be completely flawless (an ornament on a piece of jewelry, face of an action figure), try to keep the supports away from them.

PrusaSlicer 2.0 is fully equipped for automatic tree support generation. How does it work?

1. Select the object that requires supports
2. Click the SLA support points icon
3. Choose the support point density and minimal points distance (default values should work fine for a majority of objects)
4. Click Auto-generate points and wait until the process is finished
5. Use the Preview mode to inspect whether all “islands” are supported – if not, you can manually adjust the supports.



_SLA Support menu in PrusaSlicer_

Another thing that you should consider using is the pad. **The pad** (enabled by default) is a large structure at the base of the print, which serves as the foundation for the supports. While it’s possible to have supports printed directly on the aluminum printing platform, the pad will ensure much better stability.

If you're printing your model solid, it can be quite heavy. Consider **hollowing** the model or **add more supports, and/or make them thicker,** so they can support the object’s weight.

### Manual support editing

In some cases, the automatic support generation doesn’t deliver a 100% perfect result – this is normal since imported objects can be infinitely complex. We’re constantly improving our support generation subroutines to prevent these situations from happening. Either way, on certain occasions, supports have to be added manually – this can be done even when there are already auto-generated supports in place.

_Comparison of automatically generated supports and manually edited supports_

Click the **Manual editing** button. Previously generated supports will temporarily disappear to give you a better overview of the model. Use the **left mouse button** to **add new support points**. You can tweak the support thickness in manual editing mode by using the **Head diameter** slider, or you can go to **Print settings – Supports** and modify the following parameters to increase the thickness of supports:

* Support head front diameter: 0.6 mm
* Support head penetration: 0.6 mm
* Support pillar diameter: 1.3 mm

# [Object orientation](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/object-orientation_1658)

Object orientation is crucial with (M)SLA printing. It greatly influences the resulting print quality and in the case of the SL1, which cures the whole layer at once, it directly controls the print time.

You might have noticed that SLA prints are often placed at a **45-degree angle**. There are several reasons for this:

* Large flat horizontal surfaces require a lot of force to separate from the bottom of the tank when the layer is cured (they would need more supports)
* Tilted objects cover a larger area, so the supports under these objects are spread out more evenly
* Better anti-aliasing



Letting the objects grow gradually under an angle is usually the safest way to achieve good-looking prints. That said, **some objects can be placed directly on the printing platform** to achieve better results.

In the majority of cases, the object will have more than a single correct orientation. This happens usually with jewelry or various statues. The rule of thumb here is to try to rotate the object in a manner that will minimize the number of spots where the object would start in mid-air. We call these spots islands. These areas cannot be printed without supports – and since it’s generally better to avoid using supports, you should always try to find a better orientation.

You have 3 tools available to modify objects orientation:

_The Rotate tool (left), Place on face tool (middle) and Optimize orientation tool (right)_

When you have a model selected and use to Rotate tool, you can choose from 3 different auto-orientation algorithms:

* Best surface quality
* Reduced overhang slopes (minimum supports)
* Lowest Z height (lowest print time)



### Print time

Print times of the SL1 and the SL1S Speed are defined by a simple multiplication: the number of layers × (exposure time + tilt time). No matter how many (and how complex) objects there are on the print platform, the exposure times are constant throughout the print – with the exception of the first ten layers, which take slightly longer to finish.

In other words, printing a tall object will take less time, if you lay it flat on the printing platform. **Time-wise it doesn’t matter whether you place a single object on the platform – or a dozen**. The print time will always be the number of layers multiplied by the exposure time of a single layer.

With PrusaSlicer, you can print multiple models at once, each with slightly different settings. For example, with different infill or layer height.

**Right-click** ( **Advanced** mode) on a model and pick either:

* **Infill**
* **Layers and perimeters**
* **Support material**



In the **Expert** mode, an additional **Add settings** option is available that lets you adjust settings such as speed, extrusion width, infill/perimeter overlap and more.

Alternatively, you can right-click on the editing icon in the Object list.

A new window will appear in the right panel called **Object settings to modify**. Changing these settings will affect **only the relevant object and its instances**. You can remove the settings overwrite by clicking on the red cross icon. When you do so, the global settings will once again be applied.

# [Color change](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/color-change_1687)

PrusaSlicer lets you schedule a filament change at a certain layer. This can be used to print basic multicolored models. The printer automatically pauses the print as soon as it reads the color change in the G-code (M600 command) and prompts the user to proceed with the filament change.

1. A color change can be inserted from the **Preview** window
2. Drag the **layer slider** on the right to select the target layer
3. You can either
1. **Left-click** on the orange plus icon to add a color change (random preview color)
2. **Right-click** on the orange plus icon and select **Add color change**. A color picker window will appear allowing you to pick the desired color in order to get a more accurate preview
4. Repeat, you add as many color changes as you like



You can **remove** a color change by moving the slider to the target layer and left-clicking on the grey cross icon.

You can **edit** the color change preview color by right-clicking anywhere on the colored bar. Except for the first color, which can be edited by clicking on the colored rectangle next to the filament profile name in the top right corner. The preview colors are there really just to visual the final print, they have no effect on the generated G-code.

A preview is displayed instantly so you’ll see exactly how your model will look with color-change.

Keep in mind that you should use **filaments of the same type** , always mix PLA with PLA, PETG with PETG and so on. Mixing materials of different kinds will most likely lead to a failed print as they don't adhere well to each other.

The color change doesn't work in combination with sequential printing.

**Color change time estimates**

When you add one or more color changes, the Platter legend will switch to "Color Print" mode and show time estimates till each change. Alternatively, you can switch to it manually using the select box "View" in the bottom left.

This lets you plan when to check on the printer to proceed with the color change.

### Automatic color change

When PrusaSlicer detects the model looks like a logo or a sign, a notification will offer you to automatically add color changes to the correct heights. This feature was proposed by Richard Horne, thank you for the suggestion! It saves you time and removes the guesswork from inserting the color changes at the right height.

**Mute beeper when prompting color change**

If the estimated color change time happens to be during the night or another inconvenient moment, you can switch your printer’s beeper sound to _[Silent]_ , _[Mute]_ or _[once]_ mode. It is found under _Settings_ , on the LCD-menu.

### Use color change to print pictures

# [Support material](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/support-material_1698)

3D printers work by laying layer over layer of plastic to create a 3D object. Each new layer must be supported by the one beneath it. If part of your model starts in mid-air and is not supported by anything below, you need to add an additional support structure to ensure a successful print.

It is worth considering altering the orientation of the model or splitting the model into multiple parts in order to possibly reduce overhangs and consequently the amount of supports generated.

PrusaSlicer can both detect areas that need supports and generate them in these places **automatically**.

You can also set supports manually using:

Supports can be turned on from the **right panel** or in the **Print settings - Support material - Generate support material**.

There are 3 different Support styles in PrusaSlicer

When the print finishes, depending on the model geometry and material used, the support structure is often easily removable with bare hands. You can use pliers to get a better grip in otherwise hard-to-reach places. A scalpel or a utility knife can also be used to cleanly remove a piece of support that seems to be stuck to the model.

Pieces of supports can be surprisingly sharp and are sometimes violently ejected in a random direction after removal. When you encounter hard-to-remove supports,

**consider wearing protective glasses**

(this sounds stupid until you get hit in the eye for the first time).

### Supports everywhere

Supports can grow from both the print bed and any model surface when necessary.

This ensures that every overhang and part starting mid-air will get supported. However, small imperfections may appear on the surface where supports started growing from.

### Supports from build plate only

Creates only supports that have their base at the print bed.

_Supports from build plate only (left), supports everywhere (right)_

### For support enforcers only

Automatic support generation is enabled only for areas marked with a support enforcer. This option is essentially a shortcut that turns **Print settings - Support material - Generate support material** on, but **Print settings - Support material - Auto-generated supports** off.

### Supports on/off for individual models

It’s possible to print multiple objects at once each with its own support settings. By default, all models are affected by the global settings. You can overwrite them by **right-clicking** on a model in the 3D view and selecting **Support material**. Alternatively, you can right-click on the editing icon in the Object list.

A new window will appear in the right panel called **Object settings to modify - Support material**. Changing these settings will affect only the relevant object and its instances. You can remove the settings overwrite by clicking on the red cross icon. When you do so, the global settings will once again be applied.

### Support enforcer/blocker

The automatic supports can sometimes appear in hard-to-reach places, resulting in a tedious removal of support structures. If you think such a part of the model could be printed without supports, but neither the **Overhang threshold** setting nor selecting **Supports on built plate only** helped, you can adjust supports manually.

**Right-click** on a model and choose either a **Support blocker or Support enforcer**.

**Simple mode** \- Enforcers/blockers are always box-shaped

**Advanced mode** \- Box/Cylinder/Sphere/Slab shapes

**Expert mode** \- Option to load external geometry as a blocker/enforcer

Support blockers and enforcers can be manipulated with the familiar Move, Rotate, and Scale tools. You can also quickly duplicate them with copy&paste.

### Support blocker

Support blockers are useful when you’re generally happy with the automatic supports and you simply want to remove some of them. Focus on placing blockers where the supports meet the object, the rest of the support structure below will be removed automatically.

### Support enforcers

Support enforcers are great in situations, where only a few parts of the object need to be supported, but the automatic algorithm places supports all over the model. In this situation, don’t forget to switch the support mode to For support enforcers only.

It’s less common, but you can also use support enforcers with the automatic generation on.

Another interesting use of support enforcers is to split long bridges into smaller ones by placing a support in the middle of the bridge. You can repeat this process and print shorter, near-perfect bridges while still making the supports easy to remove.

Some options will only appear when

[Expert mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

is selected.

### **Generate support material**

Supports are disabled unless a model has an overwrite for this setting

### **Auto-generated supports**

When off, the overhang detection is off. Only support enforcers generate supports.

### **Overhang threshold**

The Overhang threshold value represents the most horizontal slope (measured from the horizontal plane) that you can print without support material (90=vertical).

Changing this value is a quick way to adjust the amount of generated supports.

The lower the value, the less support will be generated.

1. The Overhang threshold value and how it's measured
2. Overhang threshold 55
3. Overhang threshold 35
4. Overhang threshold 15



### **Enforce support for the first**

Generate support material for the specified number of layers counting from the bottom, regardless of whether normal support material is enabled or not and regardless of any angle threshold. This is useful for getting more adhesion of objects having a very thin or poor footprint on the build plate.

_Enforce support for the first 100 layers_

### **Raft layers**

The object will be raised by this number of layers and support material will be generated under it. When the print finishes, you can grab the raft and peel it away from the part.

The vertical distance between the raft and the object. Ignored for soluble interfaces.

### Raft expansion

Expansion of the raft in the XY plane for better stability.

### Style

Style and shape of supports. The default **Grid** supports have a very well-defined minimum area, making them very stable. However, they tend to leak out of regions they support along the walls of the object. The **Snug** supports maintain the shape of the overhang, so they do not leak to the walls. The trade-off is the possibility of lower stability of tall and thin support pillars.

_Grid supports (left), Snug supports (right)_

[**Organic supports**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/organic-supports_480131) offer a completely different approach to supporting overhanging areas. Branches of support structures grow from the sides and automatically get denser beneath parts that need the support. The Organic supports are easily removable, do not scar the surface, and are fast and cheap to print.

Grid supports (left), Organic supports (right)

The vertical distance between the object and the support material interface.

Setting this to 0 will prevent PrusaSlicer from using bridge flow and speed for the first object layer.

Values between 50-75% of the layer height seem to work well.

Similar to Top contact Z distance, but affecting the gap at the bottom of the support tower (when supports start on top of a model and not on the build plate).

### **Pattern**

Rectilinear - default, usually the easiest to remove

Rectilinear grid - sturdier and less prone to breaking during printing compared to rectilinear infill, harder to remove

Honeycomb - sturdy, somewhat difficult to remove

### **With sheath around the support**

Creates a single perimeter around the supports, which makes them sturdier, but more difficult to remove.

### **Pattern spacing**

Spacing between support material lines. Increase to make support removal easier. Support interface layers bridge over support material lines, if you increase this value too much, these bridges will start to sag and have an imperfect connection with the model.

The pattern spacing also sets the internal resolution of PrusaSlicer's supports grid. If you're using Paint-on supports or Support enforcers and you're unable to force supports exactly where you want them to be, try lowering the pattern spacing to get more resolution.

### **Pattern angle**

Rotates infill pattern angle on the horizontal plane.

### Closing radius

For Snug supports only. Gaps smaller than the closing radius will be filled in.

### **Top interface layers**

Interface layers form a more uniform surface between the object and the support material. These are preferably set to a much denser pattern than the non-interface layers so that you can both maximize the surface area of the support in contact with the model to prevent sagging while minimizing print time and material used with a bigger non-interface pattern spacing.

### Bottom interface layers

Similar as Top interface layers, but affecting the number of interface layers at the bottom of the support tower (when supports start on top of a model and not on the build plate).

### **Interface pattern spacing**

Spacing between interface lines. Set to 0 to get a solid interface.

### **Interface loops**

When enabled, the top layer of supports is covered with loops - continuous polylines.

### **Support on build plate only**

Supports can start only on the print bed. Enabling this option is a really quick way to get rid of excess supports mostly on organic shapes. Make sure to check the preview and verify that all parts are either supported or at an overhang angle manageable by the printer.

_Supports everywhere (left) vs Supports on build plate only (right)_

### **XY separation between an object and its support**

Sets the width of a gap between the model and supports. Bigger XY separation decreases the contact area of supports but makes them easier to remove and less prone to fusing to the model.

If expressed as a percentage (for example 150%) it will be calculated over the external perimeter width.

### **Don’t support bridges**

Prevents support material from being generated under bridged areas.

### **Synchronize with object layers**

Supports will be printed at equal layer heights as the model itself. This is useful with multi-material printers, where the extruder switch is expensive.

Synchronize with object layers can only be enabled with soluble supports (contact Z distance 0).

Not synchronizing with object layers allows the support layers to grow faster than the object layers (if not excessively slowed down by the cooling logic) and independent layer height also allows PrusaSlicer to follow the gap between the object and the support top surface precisely. We may consider this to be configurable even for non-soluble supports in the future.

# [Layers and perimeters](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748)

Some options will only appear when

[Expert mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

is selected.

### Layer height

Height of the individual slices/thickness of each layer. Layer height is the main factor affecting both:

* print time
* vertical resolution



By choosing **taller layer heights** you can significantly **shorten the print time** at the cost of more visible layers. On the other hand, choosing **a small layer height** (e.g. 0.10 mm) will result in **extra detail** at the cost of longer print times.

Generally, we do not suggest going lower than 0.10 mm as the improvement in print quality with 0.07 or 0.05 mm layers is relatively minor with significantly longer print times.

Keep in mind, that layer height changes only the

**vertical**

resolution. For example, an embossed text parallel with the print bed will look the same regardless of the layer height. If you’re looking for increased resolution in the XY plane,

[check nozzles with a different diameter](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/everything-about-nozzles-with-a-different-diameter_8344/)

.

**Maximum layer height for your nozzle**

The layer height should be

**below 80%**

of the

**nozzle diameter**

(e.g. the maximum layer height with a 0.4 mm nozzle is about 0.32 mm). The layer height cannot be higher than the nozzle diameter, PrusaSlicer will display an error message if you try to input such a value.

### First layer height

When printing with very low layer heights you might still want to print a thicker first layer to increase adhesion to the print bed. **Original Prusa print profiles always use 0.20 mm as the first layer height.**

You can express this as an absolute value (e.g. 0.20 mm) or as a percentage of the default layer height (e.g. 150%).

Changing the first layer height will most likely require adjusting the **calibration of the first layer** on your printer.

### Perimeters

Defines the minimum number of outlines that form the wall of a model. Original Prusa profiles always use a minimum of two perimeters.

**Increasing model strength**

The strength of a model is mostly defined by the number of perimeters (not the infill). If you want to have a stronger print, increase the number of perimeters.

### Spiral vase

Creates a continuous single outline container, gradually increasing the Z height.

When printing anything with a single-perimeter wall, there is always a small flaw where the printer advances to the next layer. This spot, where the printer stops and finishes the perimeter, raises the Z height by the layer height and starts a new perimeter, creates an unsightly ‘scar’ running up the side of the model. This scar is also a weak point of the print.

Spiral vase does not have any such point where the layer changes, with the exception of the first N bottom solid layers. Instead, the height is increasing gradually all the time, until the top of the print is reached.

When the vase mode is activated, PrusaSlicer automatically sets related settings accordingly:

* one perimeter
* 0% infill
* disabled top solid layers
* disabled supports
* disabled "ensure vertical shell thickness"



Keep in mind that simply changing these settings and not enabling the vase mode is not the same as true vase mode, as the object won’t be printed continuously.

You can still adjust the number of **bottom solid layers**. Furthermore, you can adjust the **External perimeters Extrusion width** in the **Advanced** menu to get a thicker/stronger/watertight vase (e.g. from 0.45 to 0.6).

The model should be defined as a solid. Otherwise, PrusaSlicer will try (and fail) to create both inside and outside surfaces, so model the outside dimensions only.

**Only one object at a time can be printed in the vase mode**. If you had multiple objects on the print bed, it would be impossible to print them continuously. You can get around this limitation by enabling Sequential printing.

### Recommended thin wall thickness

For a selected number of perimeters and layer height, PrusaSlicer calculates the **optimal thin wall thickness**. If you go back to your CAD drawing and change the wall thickness to this exact value, you will eliminate unnecessary perimeter overlap and your print will have a perfect wall surface finish.

Normally you get recommendations for an even number of perimeters (2,4,6…). If you enable Detect thin walls, you will also get a recommendation for an odd number of perimeters (1,3…).

You may think, that when the extrusion width for a perimeter is 0.45 mm, two perimeters will be 0.90 mm wide (2x0,45). However, if you look at the recommendation for a 0.2 mm layer height, you will find that this is not true and the suggested value is 0.86 mm.

In order to understand how this number is calculated, we need to take a look at the perimeter cross-section. PrusaSlicer assumes that the cross-section of an extrusion is a rectangle with semicircular ends. Note that the extrusion width includes the two semicircular ends.

_(This image is a re-draw of the original source:<https://manual.slic3r.org/advanced/flow-math>)_

Now let’s add a second extrusion/perimeter. If we suppose no overlap (tangent paths), there would be empty space (yellow). In order to fill the empty space and bond the perimeters together, PrusaSlicer slightly overlaps the perimeters. This is essentially why you can’t just multiply the number of perimeters by the width of a single perimeter to get the ideal wall thickness.

_(This image was heavily inspired by the original source:<https://manual.slic3r.org/advanced/flow-math>)_

Note that the layer height (h) is used in the calculation and the implication this has - if you change the layer height, your ideal wall thickness will change as well!

For more information, check the [Slic3r Flow math page](https://manual.slic3r.org/advanced/flow-math) (parts of this text are sourced from the same page).

### Solid layers - top/bottom

The bottom and top part of each model is usually filled with solid layers (100% infill).

You can set **how many top and bottom layers** you wish to print. You can also set a **minimum wall thickness** , which is especially useful when using the variable layer height function. The tooltip below these settings will update with every change you make, giving you a better idea of the resulting top/bottom wall thickness.

Setting the top or bottom solid layers to 0 overrides the minimum wall thickness. So you don't have to set the minimum wall thickness to 0 as well in order to get top or bottom layers.

The top solid infill is essentially bridging over the infill pattern. Because of that, you’ll almost always see a little bit of sag of the first few solid infill lines. The lower the infill, the longer the bridging distance, and as a result the bigger the sag. This can be counteracted by simply increasing the number of solid layers - we suggest at least 3 top layers. You can further reduce this behavior with a modifier mesh, which increases the infill for the last few layers before the solid infill.

_From left to right, 1, 2, 3, and 5 top layers, printed at 0.1 mm layer height._

Keep in mind that when you’re printing at low layer heights, you will need more solid layers to achieve the same top/bottom wall thickness (e.g. with 0.3 mm layer height use 3 top layers, with 0.1 mm layer height use 9 top layers).

The default solid infill pattern is rectilinear, however, there are several other patterns to choose from.

A legacy option that as far as we know, doesn't really do anything anymore. Let us know if you find a case where this changes anything.

### Ensure vertical shell thickness

This option was removed in PrusaSlicer 2.6. The new algorithm is much smarter than the previous implementations and it is automatically applied where needed.

This function solves one of the biggest issues of older slicers, and that is having holes between the perimeters on a slanted surface. This was typical when printing busts and other organic-looking models. Such objects typically had a few holes on top of the head. With this function enabled, PrusaSlicer makes sure it lays down the needed (internal) supports for perimeters in an upcoming layer.

### Avoid crossing perimeters

Avoid crossing perimeters is an algorithm to minimize crossings of external perimeters during travel moves, which reduces stringing (especially with Bowden extruders) and improves overall print quality.

Enabling this feature slows down the G-code generation and increases print time somewhat (time increase varies between models).

This feature was significantly improved in PrusaSlicer 2.3. The new algorithm tries to route a travel path inside object islands with the shortest path while avoiding holes and concavities, while it takes the shortest path when traveling between islands.

If the detour is longer than the **Max detour length** , avoid crossing perimeters will not be applied for this travel move. You can use absolute values in millimeters, a percentage of the travel move, or set it to 0 to disable Max detour length check.

### Detect thin walls

By default, every wall consists of outside and inside perimeters (a minimum of two perimeters for thin walls). If there is enough space for it, an infill pattern is used to fill the void between these inside/outside perimeters.

Enabling **Detect thin walls** lets PrusaSlicer generate just a single perimeter that works as both inside & outside shell. This will help to capture tiny details. However, walls thinner than a single perimeter extrusion width will likely still be ignored.

This feature is automatically disables, if the **Arachne perimeter generator** is active, as it already automatically adjusts for thin walls.

### Thick bridges

For historic reasons, PrusaSlicer used to print bridges with extremely thick lines. This makes bridging very reliable and lets you bridge longer distances, but they didn’t look very good. The new default behavior uses your current layer height for bridging, making bridging reliable for shorter distances, but looking significantly better. This is the strategy that most modern slicers use. You can switch to the old behavior by enabling the **Thick bridges** option. Since the first solid layer above supports uses the bridging settings, **this change also has a big impact on how supported overhangs look**.

_Left: Thick bridges enabled, Right: Thick bridges disabled_

### Detect bridging perimeters

Enables **bridging flow** for overhangs and turns on the fan.

### Seam position

Determines the start point of each perimeter loop, and thus the position of the potentially visible **vertical seam** on the side of the object. Unless you're printing in the Spiral vase mode.

The seam looks like a tiny zit on the model surface. PrusaSlicer can attempt to hide the seam into model edges (using the “ **Nearest** ” setting) or on the rear side (“ **Rear** ”), spread them randomly on the surface (“ **Random** ”), or arranged into lines (“ **Aligned** ”).

You'll find more information and pictures in the [Seam position](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-position_151069) article.

### External perimeters first

Perimeters will be printed from the outermost to the innermost ones instead of in the inverse order.

This parameter may help with **dimensional accuracy** since the outer perimeter is laid down first and any extra filament extruded when printing following perimeters is pressed back away from the outer wall. On the other hand, the surface may be slightly less smooth.

### Fill gaps

Enables filling of gaps between individual perimeters and between the innermost perimeter and infill.

### Perimeter generator

Allow you to switch between the Arachne (default) and the Classic perimeter generator. The Arachne perimeter generator automatically adjusts the extrusion width of perimeters as needed. For most prints the Arachne perimeter generator is superior, but for some functional prints where the accuracy of concave corners is important, the classic perimeter generator may be better.

# [Undo / Redo](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/undo-redo_1749)

All the actions accessible from the 3D editor view are undoable including object selection, actions at the sidebar (adding modifiers, changing their attributes) with the exception of switching the print, filament, SLA material profiles.

Ctrl \+ Y (or Ctrl \+ Shift \+ Z) **Redo**

You can undo or redo multiple steps at once by right-clicking on the Undo or Redo button and selecting a point in history. As each of the snapshots have an expressive name assigned, it is easy to orient even in a long list of actions.

Changing parameters in the Print / Filament / SLA Material or Printer tab is already undoable with the "Reset to system value" and "Reset to user saved value" buttons, therefore we decided to not put the events of modifying these parameters onto the Undo / Redo stack of the plater.

# [Variable layer height function](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/variable-layer-height-function_1750)

PrusaSlicer lets you define different regions of your model to be printed with a different layer height and automatically smooth the transition between them. This can result in significantly shorter print times with minimal sacrifice to the print quality.

The variable layer height can be set up either **automatically** , **manually** or you can **combine the two workflows together**.

### Setting up variable layer height

First, select a model in the 3D view. Then the variable layer height tool becomes available in the top toolbar. As soon as you activate it a **realtime preview of the contour lines** created by individual layers is displayed. A new window appears in the bottom right corner and a new panel is displayed on the right side of the 3D view.

Calculates the layer profile according to the Quality/Speed setting.

By moving this slider you can change the ratio of small and tall layers. Hit the **Adaptive** button to see the new variable layer profile.

As the name suggests, this smoothes the layer variable layer height profile. A bigger **radius** will smooth the curve more. **You can press this button repeatedly** to get an even smoother result.

When enabled the **smallest layer heights(green** ) won't be smoothed and will remain at their minimum value.

Resets the variable layer height settings (both automatic and manual changes).

You can manually edit the result of the automatic variable layer height.
You can also skip the automatic step completely and set everything manually.

When you hover the mouse above the variable layer height panel (on the right), the affected part of the model is highlighted in yellow.

Left mouse button **Add detail**

Right mouse button **Remove detail**

Shift \+ Left mouse button **Reset to base**

Shift \+ Right mouse button **Smoothing**

Mouse wheel **Increase od decrease the edited area**

Note that **all instances** of the object **are also affected** by the variable layer height tool.

You may notice a **sharp jump on the bottom** of the blue line - **that’s normal** and it’s a visual representation of the first layer height setting.

_A practical example of variable layer height_

#### What layer height profile should you pick?

Try to select a profile with a layer height that's close to what the majority of the print will be printed at. You could say that it doesn't really matter, if you move the slider to favor more quality/speed you can get really small layer heights even if you have a really tall layer profile selected. However, the profiles also change other things except for just the layer height - tall layers get wider extrusion, for example. A good "average" layer height profile (e.g. 0.15 mm layer height profile for 0.4 mm nozzle) will most likely also work well for most cases.

### Automatic variable layer height metrics

We have experimented with various metrics for surface quality. The metrics by [Florens Wasserfall et al.](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/publications/2017/Adaptive%20Slicing%20for%20the%20FDM%20Process%20Revisited.pdf) implemented in **Slic3r** limits the maximum discretization error (largest Euclidean distance of the stepped surface from the source model).

**Cura** limits the maximum distance of [contour lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line) in the XY plane, producing more intuitive results than the metric by Waserfall.

In the end, we have implemented yet another metric, limiting the cross-section area between the stepped surface and the source model. The following graph shows the layer height limit of various metrics depending on the surface slope.

# [Split to objects/parts](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/split-to-objects-parts_1751)

In 3D printing (and modeling, animation and more), objects are represented by their **outer shell**. This shell is represented as a triangle mesh. It’s possible to have several meshes inside a single file.

STL files will always get imported as a single object, no matter how many separate shells are included in the file.

3MF files support multiple objects natively, each object will be properly identified and loaded as a separate entity.

Sometimes this is done on purpose, for example, when you export the entire platter as a single STL or when you export a multi-material model. You may want to separate the shells in order to transform individual objects independently of each other or set different print settings for different models. PrusaSlicer can automatically identify multiple shells inside a single file and split them into separate models.

Select the model you wish to split and click either on **Split to objects** or **Split to parts** in the top toolbar.

### Split to objects

* Creates an individual object for each shell
* Places each newly created object on the print bed



### Split to parts

* Keeps a single model object in the scene, but creates multiple parts
* Parts stay in their original location, even if they’re floating in mid-air above the print bed
* Usually used to split MMU models without misaligning individual parts

# [First print with PrusaSlicer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-print-with-prusaslicer_1753)

### Model import

First, you have to import your model. You can either **drag and drop** it directly to the PrusaSlicer window, use the **Add button** in the top toolbar or choose **File - Import**.

Supported 3D formats are STL, STEP, 3MF, OBJ, and AMF.

### Model orientation

It’s possible that your model may be oriented incorrectly after import. If that’s the case you can use to **Rotate tool** R to manually adjust to the object’s orientation. When you pick a rotation axis, you can use the short guidelines to rotate by 5-degree increments or the long guidelines, which snap to 45-degree increments.

Alternatively, you can use the Place on Face tool. When you select it, several white planes will appear on your model. Clicking on the white plane will align it with the virtual print bed.

### Selecting printer

If you only selected one printer and nozzle size in the [Configuration Wizard](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/configuration-wizard_1754), you already have the correct printer selected. If you chose to import multiple printer profiles, select the one you wish to use from the drop-down menu in the right panel.

### Selecting material

Different materials require different print temperatures, print speed, cooling, and a variety of other settings. Luckily, PrusaSlicer comes with presets for many different materials, so you just have to select one from the drop-down menu in the right panel.

### Selecting a print profile/layer height

By adjusting the height of the individual printed layers you can balance the print quality and the print time. PrusaSlicer has various print profiles to select from. To start we suggest using 0.15 or 0.2 mm layers as they offer very good print quality at reasonable print times.

### Supports

Because each layer rests on top of the previous one, it may be necessary to print a support structure underneath parts, that would otherwise be printed in mid-air. Additionally, it’s difficult for the printer to reproduce very steep overhangs. PrusaSlicer can detect where to place supports and generate them automatically. To turn supports on pick either Supports: Everywhere or Supports: On build plate only from the drop-down menu in the right panel.

A model that needs supports (left), a model with generated supports (right)

### Infill

Objects are typically not printed solid, but not hollow either. A sparse infill pattern is used to fill the inside of the model. The main purpose of the infill is to provide an internal support structure for top layers, as well as to improve the mechanical properties of the print. On the other hand, we usually want to get away with as little infill as possible to reduce both print times and material consumption.
The amount of infill can be adjusted in the right panel. Generally, values around 15% work well.

### Brim

A brim is used to increase adhesion to the print bed and decrease the possibility of warping. This is done by printing extra outlines of the first layer and it’s especially useful when the footprint of the first layer is very small. You can turn it on with a checkbox in the right panel. When the print is finished, it’s usually very easy to remove the brim by hand.

### Previewing G-code before print

It’s a good practice to always preview the G-code before printing it. When you click the Slice now button, you’ll be automatically switched to the preview mode. Alternatively, you can use the switch between 3D view and preview mode in the lower-left corner or press the TAB key. Using the slider on the right, you can adjust the preview and inspect individual layers. Check the overall shape of the model and make sure it matches the 3D object. Watch out for parts, that would start printing in mid-air, if you notice any, it’s necessary to turn on support generation. If everything looks alright, you can proceed and select Export G-code.

### Exporting the G-code

PrusaSlicer automatically detects if you insert an SD card, USB flash drive, or other removable media.

When detected, a new Export to SD/USB drive button will appear next to the Export G-code button (bottom right corner). Clicking it will open the file save dialog with the path initialized to the SD card or USB flash drive.

If multiple SD cards or USB flash drives are detected, the file dialog is opened at the last visited removable media.
Once a G-code is exported to a removable media, an Eject button is shown next to the Export G-code button, which will safely disconnect your device.

# [Configuration Wizard](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/configuration-wizard_1754)

When you launch PrusaSlicer for the first time, you’ll be greeted with a Configuration Wizard. Configuration Wizard can also be launched manually at any time from the top menu by selecting Configuration - Configuration Wizard.

The FFF printer selection lets you select which printer profiles you wish to import. Original Prusa printers come with a 0.4 mm nozzle, however, if you plan to purchase different diameter nozzles, you can import additional profiles by ticking the appropriate checkboxes. Additional profiles can also be imported at a later time.

**The Original Prusa MK3S and MK3S+ can use the same printer configuration!**

PrusaSlicer also supports MSLA slicing. At the moment the only officially supported MSLA printer is the Original Prusa SL1.

Starting with version 2.2, PrusaSlicer also includes profiles for 3rd party vendors (e.g. Lulzbot printers). You can select which vendor profiles you wish to enable.

If you selected any 3rd party printer manufacturers, you'll be able to select which printer profiles from each vendor you wish to import.

The collection of 3rd party vendor profiles is currently quite small, we'll be expanding this collection in the future.

You can also define a custom printer profile. However, this function is mostly for printer manufacturers and expert users.

Last but not least, you can choose to automatically check for application updates and to automatically update the built-in profiles. We suggest leaving both of these on.

---

# [Miscellaneous](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/miscellaneous_1755)

### Locked lock icon

Every setting on the Print, Filament and Printer tab has either a locked or unlocked lock icon next to it. The locked lock icon indicates that the value is the same as in the currently selected profile. As soon as the value is changed, the icon changes to unlocked lock and a back arrow appears, which lets you reset back to the value from the print profile. In addition to that, the label turns orange. This enables you to quickly spot settings that has been changed.

### Colorblind mode

If you have one of the several different types of color blindness, you can customize some of the colors PrusaSlicer uses. Click on the red question mark in the Print, Material or Printer settings tab. Then you can click on one of the two colors at the bottom of the new window and set a different color.

---

# [Object manipulation panel](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/object-manipulation-panel_1757)

Whenever you have one or more objects selected, the Object manipulation panel appears in the right panel.

Using the text inputs, you can quickly modify:

* Position
* Rotation
* Scale factor
* Size



The scale can quickly be set back to 100% using the **orange reset arrow button**.

When you’re transforming a modifier or a part of a model consisting of multiple parts, a handy place on the print bed button appears whenever the selected object is above or below the print bed.

If you switch from World to Local coordinates, you can use 3 quick mirror buttons.

### Local vs World coordinates

In the Advanced and Expert mode, a switch between Local and World coordinates becomes available.

The local coordinate system is constant in relation to the object. The world coordinates are constant in relation to the print bed. That means an object’s size will change in the world coordinates as you rotate it, for example, around the Z-axis. The size in local coordinates is constant no matter the rotation around any of the axes.

Local coordinates (left) vs World coordinates (right)

---

# [Object list](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/object-list_1758)

The Object list is located in the right panel and shows a hierarchy of:

* Objects (models)
* Instances
* Custom parameters for each object
* Modifiers - Height range modifiers and Modifier meshes
* Support blockers and enforcers



You can get a clear idea of the project structure just by looking at the object tree.

You can **double-click** on a model name in the Object list to rename it. That can be handy when you print multiple parts with generic names exported from CAD software.

The **eye icon** toggles the printable property. When you disable it, the model will stay on the print bed, but the slicing software will ignore this model during the G-code generation.

Clicking on the **Editing** icon will open a context menu, which lets you customize the settings for the selected object.

---

# [Perspective/orthographic camera](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/perspective-orthographic-camera_1760)

You can quickly switch between the perspective and orthographic camera using the K or in the top toolbar by ticking **Configuration - Preferences - Use perspective camera**. Both cameras have their advantages and it’s beneficial to switch between them depending on your current needs.

### Perspective camera (default)

The perspective camera gives you more information about depth, objects which are far away are smaller than those nearby. A perspective view is as seen by human eyes in the real world.

### Orthographic camera

The orthographic camera is commonly used in engineering. All objects appear at the same scale, parallel lines remain parallel and a unit of length will appear to have the same length everywhere on the drawing. This makes it easier to judge relative sizes and to align models.

# [Keyboard shortcuts](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/keyboard-shortcuts_1764)

Almost every function of PusaSlicer can be accessed via a keyboard shortcut. In addition to that, many functions have an alternative mode that can be accessed with a modifier key. They are **a great time-saver** and we suggest learning keyboard shortcuts at least for the most commonly used tools, such as the Move M, Rotate R and Scale S tools.

The list of all keyboard shortcuts can be displayed in the **Help – Keyboard shortcuts** window (or by pressing Shift+?).

Alternatively, you can hover over a tool icon and the keyboard shortcut will be displayed after a short delay.

On macOS, the Command (⌘) key is used instead of the Ctrl key.

# [Simple, Advanced, Expert modes](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

The user interface changes in appearance depending on the mode you’re in. You can switch to a different mode using the buttons in the right panel or by going to **Configuration - Mode - Simple/Advanced/Expert**.

The reasoning behind the **Simple mode** is to lower the learning curve for beginners and declutter the user interface for casual users. **Complex features** like modifier meshes **are hidden** , and only a basic subset of parameters is shown to the user.

In the Advanced mode, more parameters are shown, and in the Expert mode, all the power features of PrusaSlicer are accessible. To make the learning of parameters easier, we color-coded them

* **Green** – safe to be tinkered with by a beginner
* **Yellow** – advanced user may want to modify these parameters
* **Red** – expert settings most of which should only be touched if you’re making a profile for a new printer

---

# [UI overview](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ui-overview_1766)

PrusaSlicer has a fairly simple user interface. The majority of the screen is dedicated to the 3D view, which is used to manipulate 3D models. The top toolbar (1,2) is used to add and remove objects. The left toolbar (4) has tools for manipulation with 3D models, such as the scale or rotate tool. The right panel is used mainly to select a print, filament and printer profile (6,7,8) and to choose whether or not to generate supports or brim.

The “Slice now” button (5) is used to generate G-code, which can then be exported to an SD card or sent directly to a printer. Some of the advanced functions are hidden by default, you can enable them later by switching to the Advanced or Expert mode (12).

1. The **Add** button loads models into PrusaSlicer
2. **Delete** and **Delete All** buttons remove the model(s) from PrusaSlicer
3. Opens detailed settings of print, filament and printer
4. **Move, Scale, Rotate, Place on Face** and C **ut** tools
5. Slice and generate G-code button
6. Quality / Speed setting of a print
7. Material selection
8. Printer selection
9. **Right-click** on model opens a context menu
10. Switch between 3D editor and layers preview
11. Model preview
12. Switch between Simple / Advanced / Expert mode

# [Modifiers](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/modifiers_1767)

In some cases, you might want to **change some settings just for a specific section of your model**. For example, you might want part of your model to have denser infill or more perimeters for increased rigidity. But you don’t want to adjust these settings globally, because that would waste a lot of material and increase the print time.

There are multiple ways to specify which section of the model should be affected by the custom settings. You can use a height range modifier, simple modifier mesh primitive (e.g. cube) or a custom model modifier mesh.

### Height range modifier

**Right-click** on a model and pick **Height range modifier** from the context menu.

A new window will appear in the right panel called **Height ranges**. Here you set intervals, between which you can apply different settings. When you set an interval, it will appear in the Object list in the right panel.

You can add or remove intervals with the orange **plus** and **minus** icons.

When you click on the gear icon next to the interval, you can choose to set up:

**Advanced mode** \- custom infill, layers, and perimeters or support material

**Expert mode** \- custom infill, layers and perimeters, support material, extrusion width, speed, and several other settings

The interval setting also features a **layer height input**. By default, the global layer setting is used, but you can choose to slice the model at a different layer height and only the interval will be affected by this change. Keep in mind that if you set up a different layer height for the entire model, on the height interval it will be overridden by this value.

_A height range modifier was used to set the top and bottom layers to 0 and to change the infill pattern to triangles for the bottom (black) part of the model_

### Modifier meshes

**Modifier meshes apply custom settings to the intersection of the modifier mesh and the model.**

**Right-click** on a model and pick **Add modifier - [Select modifier type]**. Alternatively, you can right-click on the gear icon in the Object list panel.

#### Modifier mesh shape

There are 4 primitives to choose from - Cube, Cylinder, Sphere and Slab.

Additionally, in the expert mode, you can use a **custom shape as a modifier mesh** by selecting **Load …** in the mesh selection. This mesh is typically something you’ve modeled beforehand in a 3D modeling program.

_A modifier mesh in the shape of a rectangle that removes top and bottom solid layers and another one in the shape of a plane that turns them back on and changes the extruder to number 2 (printed with the MMU2S)_

When you pick the modifier shape (e.g. cube) it will appear in the 3D view and in the Object list in the right panel.

#### Changing settings for the modifier mesh

You can either **right-click on the modifier** in the 3D view or click on the **gear icon** in the Object list panel to select:

* **Advanced mode** \- custom infill, layers, and perimeters or support material
* **Expert mode** \- custom infill, layers and perimeters, support material, extrusion width, speed, and several other settings



Some settings are only available in **Advanced and Expert-mode** : **Advanced mode** \- custom infill, layers, and perimeters or support material **Expert mode** \- custom infill, layers and perimeters, support material, extrusion width, speed, and several other settings

If you scale the model then both model and modifier-mesh will scale. Modifier-mesh will retain it's size and position relative to the model.

#### Place modifier on bed

If you moved a modifier above the print bed you can use the button in the Part manipulation panel to place it back down.

---

# [Copy, paste, instances](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/copy-paste-instances_1769)

### Copy & paste

You can select one or more models and copy/paste them using the buttons in the top toolbar or with the familiar shortcuts:

Object copies include everything from modifiers to object instances or support blockers and enforcers.

### Add / remove instance

You can add or remove instances by selecting a model and then clicking on the plus or minus icons in the top toolbar or using the keyboard shortcut:

This option is also available in the context menu when you right-click on a model. The context menu also has the option Set number of instances, which is useful when you need to print many smaller objects.

Copy Ctrl+C and Paste Ctrl+V do not create instances but copies independent of the parent object.

### Object instances

Objects instances are essentially copies of an object, which are linked together and share the same settings and orientation, except for the Z-axis rotation. They’re extremely useful when you want to quickly set-up a print with multiple copies of the same model.

When you scale any of the instances, all of them will change in scale. When you cut the bottom of a model, all of the instances will be cut, etc.

### Fill bed with instances

Fill bed with instances feature fills the print bed with the maximum number of copies of a selected object. This feature is accessible from the context menu after right-clicking on an object.

Fill bed with instances uses the current [Auto-arrange](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/auto-arrange-tool_1770) spacing and rotation settings. That means if you lower the spacing and enable rotations, the algorithm will likely be able to fill more objects on the build plate.

### Separating an instance from the parent object

Right-click on an instance and choose Set as a separated object. Alternatively, you can drag the instance in the Object list away from the parent object.

Separated instances behave like a standalone object and their modifications will only affect them. That said, you can create instances of this new object, that will again be parented to it.

---

# [Auto-arrange tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/auto-arrange-tool_1770)

When you import multiple models or create many instances of the same model, arranging them on the print bed could be very time-consuming. PrusaSlicer features an auto-arrange tool that distributes the objects over the entire Print bed with a reasonable gap between them. Auto-arrange can be initiated either by hitting the A key or by picking the Auto-arrange from the top toolbar.

### Partial arrangement

The Auto-arrange tool can be used to arrange only a subset of the objects on the bed while keeping the position of unselected objects unchanged. This can be achieved by selecting the set of objects and hitting the Arrange button while holding down the Shift key, or pressing the Shift \+ A hotkey.

### Customizable gap and automatic rotation

Starting with PrusaSlicer 2.3, **right-clicking the Auto-arrange icon** in the top toolbar opens a dialog to tune the distance between objects and to allow rotation of objects around their Z-axis during the arrangement. As a result, you’ll be able to fit more parts on the build plate.

You can either use the slider to set the spacing or enter an exact value by Ctrl+Left mouse button clicking into the text field.

The current spacing and rotation settings also affect the [Fill bed with instances](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/copy-paste-instances_1769#fill-bed-with-instances) function.

---

# [Export](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/export_1771)

All models on the print bed and all of PrusaSlicer settings can be saved as a single [3MF Project file](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/saving-projects-as-3mf_1773) via the **File - Save menu**.

Uploading a

**3MF**

file is a great way to share your model online. Compared to STL, 3MF includes additional information such as thumbnail, custom supports, variable layer height, and more!

Alternatively, all models on the print bed can be exported as a single STL via **File - Export - Export plate as STL**.

You can also export individual models as STL. **Right-click** on any of the models in the 3D view and select **Export as STL...** This can be useful if you created changes to the model inside PrusaSlicer, such as cutting the model.

In the SLA mode, it’s possible to also include tree supports (as non-editable STL) via the **File - Export plate as STL including the supports** menu.

_Lastly, the entire platter can be exported as AMF via the File - Export - Export plate as AMF menu._

---

# [Supported file formats](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/supported-file-formats_1772)

### 3MF

The preferred file format also used to save [Project files](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/saving-projects-as-3mf_1773).

### STL

Both binary an ASCII format is supported.

### STEP

The STEP file is triangulated during import.

### OBJ

Information such as material and texture is ignored during import.

### AMF

Even though AMF is supported, we suggest using 3MF instead. We described the reasons why we prefer 3MF in [this article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/3mf-file-format-and-why-its-great_30986/).

---

# [Saving projects as 3MF](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/saving-projects-as-3mf_1773)

**File – Save Project** saves a 3MF file containing all objects, settings, modifiers and their parameters. It’s essentially **a complete snapshot of PrusaSlicer**.

When you open a project file on a different computer, it should still produce the same G-code.

**We always save project files when we slice something** (unless we're 100% sure that it's a one-time thing). If you re-visit the project later on and want to modify something, it's really handy that you can instantly load the exact same settings you used when you first printed it. Plus it's the best way to share the model with someone who also owns a Prusa printer.

### 3MF file format

Unlike an STL file, which only stores the geometry of an object (as a series of surface triangles), a 3MF file is able to store a variety of different files in a single archive, such as:

* Multiple models
* **Slicer settings**
* Thumbnail
* Color
* Texture



You can change the “.3mf” extension on your 3D model to “.zip,” and see the contents just as you would with a standard Zip file. The file size is also significantly smaller, compared to STL.

Learn more about 3MF [here](https://3mf.io/).

---

# [Macros](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/macros_1775)

Macros allow you to create conditions and evaluate math equations in the Custom G-code fields.

PrusaSlicer macro language is not compatible with Slic3r conditional expressions.

### Constructs

#### Conditional evaluation


{if <condition_1>}<GCode_condition_1>[][{else}<GCode_else>]{endif}

#### Expression evaluation

#### Legacy Placeholder syntax


[variable]

or


[variable_index]

Inside either construct, PrusaSlicer configuration variables can be accessed by their names

and elements of vector variables can be accessed by using square braces

refers to the temperature of the first extruder.

Multidimensional vectors can currently be only accessed as a simple vector variable resulting in a string value (e.g. if the _extruder_variable[1]_ resulting in [n,0] string value -- can be posted in g-code but can not be used in arithmetic operations).

Strings are identified by double quotes


"string"

and regular expressions by slashes


/regex/

Strings are not parsed recursively, i.e. curly and square brackets inside strings will appear in the output. This allows constructs such as


{"[text in square brackets]"}

### Operators

The following operators are allowed:

1. Comparison

<, >, ==, !=, <>, <=, >=

2. Boolean logic

and, or, not

or, equivalently,

&&, ||, !

3. Arithmetics

+, -, , /

4. Ternary operator

(<condition>? <cond_true>:<cond_false>)

This needs to be enclosed in parentheses to work.
5. Regular expression matching

(=~ (matching), !~ (not matching))

6. Regular expressions are enclosed in slashes _/_



### Functions

Casting to integer


int(a)

Rounding to an integer


round(a)

Rounding / padding with spaces: rounds fractional part to num_decimals digits (adding trailing zeros if needed), then left fills with spaces so the number has num_digits characters in total (including a decimal point if present). Last argument can be omitted, defaults to zero.


digits(a, num_digits, num_decimals=0)

Rounding / padding with zeros: same as above, only left filled with zeros


zdigits(a, num_digits, num_decimals=0)

Check if the configuration option is active


is_nil(config_option_name)

### Variables (placeholders)

You can use variables inside customs scripts and in the output file name template.

Check the [List of all PrusaSlicer placeholders](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/list-of-placeholders_205643), grouped according to their scope.

####

#### Scalar variables

These values are scalar and can be directly referenced.

* printer_notes (string)
* layer_z (only available in layer change GCode)
* layer_num (only available in layer change GCode)
* toolchange_z (available in custom toolchange GCode since version 2.4.0)



Some variables are defined by complex formulas. For example, the _perimeter_extrusion_width_ if left to zero takes the value of _extrusion_width_ if non zero, otherwise a default _perimeter_extrusion_width_ is calculated for the current _layer_height_. These substitutions are only done for the new syntax expressions (enclosed in curly braces {}), while the expressions written using the old placeholder syntax (enclosed in square braces []) are interpreted verbatim.

#### Vector (array variables)

These variables are arrays and need to be accessed as such (e.g. temperature[0]).

* temperature
* first_layer_temperature
* bed_temperature (note that this is a vector, even though only one value makes sense: bed_temperature[0])
* first_layer_bed_temperature (same as above!)



#### Multidimensional vector

These variables can only be accessed as simple vectors and can not be used in arithmetic expressions.

* extruder_offset
* bed_shape



#### Temp tower

You can use the "Before layer change" custom G-code to slowly decrease hot end temperatures. First, one may use the if/elsif/else expression:


{if layer_z < 10}M104 S265
{elsif layer_z < 17}M104 S260
{elsif layer_z < 24}M104 S255
{elsif layer_z < 31}M104 S250
{elsif layer_z < 38}M104 S245
{elsif layer_z < 45}M104 S240
{endif}

The same result may be achieved by a shorter if/else/endif expression together with a linear interpolation:


M104 S{if layer_z < 10}265{elsif layer_z > 45}240{else}{265+(240-265)*(layer_z-10.0)/(45-10)}{endif}

Or one may use the ternary operator:


M104 S{((layer_z < 10) ? 265 : ((layer_z > 45) ? 240 : 265+(240-265)*(layer_z-10.0)/(45-10)))}

#### Faster heat up with weak bed heaters before print

If you have a bed that takes a very long time to get up to temperature you can shave off a little bit of waiting time by using "Start G-code" to heat up the bed to the destination temperature minus 5 degrees and then starting to warm up the hot end while the bed continues to heat to the target value:


M190 S{first_layer_bed_temperature[0] - 5} ; wait for bed temperature - 5
M140 S[first_layer_bed_temperature] ; continue bed heating using legacy [<variable>] syntax
M109 S[first_layer_temperature] ; wait for nozzle temperature

# [Configuration snapshots](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/configuration-snapshots_1776)

A snapshot contains complete configuration, most importantly all system and user profiles, from the point when the snapshot was taken. You can view and move back and forth between snapshots using the **Configuration - Configuration snapshots menu**.

If you have the _Update built-in presets automatically_ enabled in **Preferences** , a new snapshot is created before each update. You can manually create a snapshot by selecting **Configuration - Take Configuration Snapshot**.

You can load a snapshot using the **Activate** button.

# [Export toolpaths as OBJ](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/export-toolpaths-as-obj_1777)

Exporting the sliced model as OBJ can be useful if you’re familiar with a 3D modeling and rendering program. When you slice a model, you can choose **File - Export - Export toolpath as OBJ**. You can then import that file into a 3D software that you like, such as Blender, and render photorealistic previews or even animations of the print.

The export includes everything you currently see in the Preview. That means, if you use the layer slider to preview a cross-section of the model, the exported file will include only the layers visible in the Preview.

If you plan to render only the outside of the sliced model, we recommend turning the infill off completely, keeping the layer height above 0,15 mm, and decreasing the number of perimeters to 2 in order to reduce the polygon count. Still, you can expect several million polygons per model.

# [Cut tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cut-tool_1779)

In some cases, you might want to cut a model into multiple pieces before printing:

* the model is too big to be printed in one piece
* you only want to print a part of a model
* a part of the model needs a different print orientation for added strength
* printing the model in one piece would require a needlessly large amount of support material



PrusaSlicer provides an advanced cutting function:

* Cut models at any angle
* Select which parts to separate and which to keep connected
* Generate connectors and dowel pins for easy assembly



Select the object and press the C key or pick the **Cut tool** from the left toolbar. A 3D gizmo and a context menu will appear. Using the gizmo, you can drag the cutting plane to your desired position. To set the cutting plane position, you can also enter an exact value [mm] in the context menu. To change the rotation of the cutting plane, use the arrows on top of the gizmo.

You can also hold down the Shift key and click on two points on the screen to quickly define a cutting plane. The cutting plane will be perpendicular to the current view.

For both the top and bottom part, you have the option to:

* **Keep** \- toggles whether the part should remain in the 3D view or be deleted after the cut
* **Place on cut** \- rotates the parts so that the cut area aligns perfectly with the heatbed
* **Flip** \- rotates the model upside down after cutting



### Select which parts to separate and which to keep connected

If the cutting plane intersects the model in several different regions, you can select which parts to cut and which to keep connected by right-clicking on them.

### Adding connectors and dowel pins

We understand how important it is to assemble the final parts together with an emphasis on precision and simplicity. That’s why we added an option to define various types of connectors. You can control the depth, size, and tolerances of each connector and the negative hole.

The **Plug** type will add extra geometry to one side of the cut and subtract it from the other side. The **Dowel** type will subtract the pin from both sides and generate and extra object to print as the connector.

# [Place on Face tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/place-on-face-tool_1781)

It’s possible that a model will be oriented incorrectly after import. This happens especially when the model was exported from a 3D modeling software that uses a different axis orientation. The **fastest** way to rotate the model into correct orientations is with the Place on Face tool F.

First, select a model you wish to re-orient. Then press the F key or pick the **Place on Face tool** from the left toolbar. Multiple white planes will appear on the model. Clicking on any of the white planes will align that plane with the print bed.

# [FAQ - PrusaSlicer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/faq-prusaslicer_1789)

**Q: Is PrusaSlicer free?**
A: Yes. It’s also open-source, so anyone can contribute to the development. Check our [GitHub](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer).

**Q: Can I use it with other printers (not Original Prusa)?**
A: Yes. The community has made profiles for printers from many manufacturers. Many of them are now built-in to PrusaSlicer, you can add them via the Configuration Wizard. For printers that are not yet included, you can check your printer’s Facebook group or a forum, download the profiles and import them manually.

**Q: Where are user profiles stored?
** Select **Help - Show Configuration Folder**

**Windows** _C:/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/PrusaSlicer
_ **Mac** “HDD” ▸ ⁨Users⁩ ▸ ⁨username⁩ ▸ ⁨Library⁩ ▸ ⁨Application Support⁩ ▸ ⁨PrusaSlicer _
_ **Linux** ~/.config/PrusaSlicer
If you're using an alpha or beta version, the folder name will be PrusaSlicer-alpha or PrusaSlicer-beta respectively

**Q: Did an update erase all my custom print profiles?**
A: **No** , PrusaSlicer always creates a backup of all print profiles before an update. Check the _snapshots folder.
_ **Windows** _C:Users/username/AppData/Roaming/PrusaSlicer/snapshots
_ **Mac** “HDD” ▸ ⁨Users⁩ ▸ ⁨username⁩ ▸ ⁨Library⁩ ▸ ⁨Application Support⁩ ▸ ⁨PrusaSlicer⁩ ▸ snapshots _
_ **Linux** ~/.config/PrusaSlicer/snapshots _
_

**Q: Does it have custom supports?**
A: Yes. Check the [Paint-on supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/paint-on-supports_168584) and [support blockers and enforcers](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/support-material_1698).

**Q: How to orient my model so that one of its faces is on the print bed?**
A: Check the Place on Face function.

**Q: Can I schedule a pause or a color change in PrusaSlicer?**
A: Yes, click the plus icon on the slider in the Preview mode.

**Q: What is the correct spelling: Plater or Platter?
** A: Feel free to discuss at [#2074](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2074) or [#1226](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1226), we're keeping it as _Plater_.

**Q: Does it have tree supports for FDM?**
A: No, at least for the time being. We are looking into how to make them work with FDM.

**Q: How accurate are the print time estimates?
** A: Very accurate, often less than a minute difference on a print that takes 10+ hours. However, this is only true if you select the correct printer profile that matches your actual printer. The print time estimate takes into account acceleration, jerk and other settings that differ from machine to machine.

**Q: How do I import a custom profile
** A: File - Import - Import config

**Q: Why is there an extrusion hanging in the air over a MMU (multi-material) wipe tower?
** A: That is the final ramming before the filament is pulled from the nozzle and parked into the filament switcher. See [#1355](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1355) for further details.

**Q: Why is the jerk unit in mm/s, if the physical unit should be the rate of change in acceleration = mm/s^3?
** A: The [GRBL](https://github.com/gnea/grbl) project overloaded the term "jerk" to define maximum instantaneous velocity change, which is easier to be implemented by 8bit controllers, and most of today's 3D printer firmware is based on the GRBL planner. See [#1355](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2339) for further details.

**Q: PrusaSlicer won't start on Ubuntu
A: **This may be due to missing package


overlay-scrollbar-gtk2

, install it using the following command:


sudo apt-get install --reinstall overlay-scrollbar-gtk2

**Q: When exporting a G-code, the file save dialog shows


{print_time}

tag in the file name instead of the actual print time, why?
**A: This happens if you click on the Export G-code button right after slicing and the G-code analysis is still running on the background. If you save the file, the tag will be properly replaced with the time estimate.

**Q: Strange pattern on a flat surface
** A: A perfectly flat surface may not stay perfectly flat after being rotated in a 3D modeling software. If PrusaSlicer happens to slice across such a no more perfectly flat surface, weird one layer thick islands may show up. See [#2434](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2434) for further details.

**Q: PrusaSlicer freezes or gets stuck after launch and is not responding (often when opened on 2nd monitor), what's wrong?
** A1: This is likely caused by the Nahimic audio driver, which some notebook/pc manufacturers pre-install on their machines. You can solve the issue by stopping and disabling the Nahimic driver. You can learn more in this [forum thread](https://forum.prusaprinters.org/forum/prusaslicer/pursaslicer-2-0-0-not-responding/paged/2/#post-195065) or on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2522) page.
A2: You may be running an app that integrates with other applications, such as the Blue Cielo "Application Integration". Such apps autoload at startup and inspect/change menu bars etc. If you discover such an app on your device, whitelist PrusaSlicer. More info on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2939).

**Q: How can I move a model up in the Z direction?
** A: Place your base object normally, then right click on it and 'add part', select the model that you want to place on top. More information is in [this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/how-to-lift-object-from-the-print-bed_245192?preview=true). As well as the explanation why this can't be done easier at the moment.

#### FAQ for other vendors:

**Q: We would like to modify (possibly re-skin) PrusaSlicer and release it for our customers, is that ok?**
A: Yes. However, you will have to release the full source code including all the changes that you've made. Please check the [_GNU Affero General Public License, version 3_](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

**Q: We would like to use PrusaSlicer to create a cloud slicing service
** A: Feel free to do so, but just like when releasing a modified version, you will have to release the full source code including all the changes that you've made. Please check the [_GNU Affero General Public License, version 3_](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

# [About Octoprint](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/about-octoprint_1790)

**Octoprint** is an open-source system for remotely controlling and monitor your printer. Start/stop/pause prints, change printing temperatures and settings while printing, stream video, or captures images during printing. It does almost everything. With the [wide range of plugins available](https://plugins.octoprint.org/) you can even have more advanced features like being notified by WhatsApp or post on social media when a print completes. It uses a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), a cheap, single-board Linux-computer for processing and interfacing.


Since we develop neither Raspberry Pi nor Octoprint, we are only able to provide limited support on its use. Also, connection-issues is more likely a configuration-error with your PI or home-router, which unfortunately is also not our field.

Working with [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and Raspberry Pi can for some seem daunting, but results are powerful so if this sounds like something for you, check out the links below for guides and more information.

# [Print detached from supports (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/print-detached-from-supports-sl1-sl1s_1791)

### Why is this happening?

If the printed object detaches from its supports mid-print, it will fall into the resin tank, usually with the supports still attached to the printing platform. This is normally caused by a combination of the printed object’s weight and insufficient supports. Too heavy (solid) objects may be too much for default supports and as a result, they often detach once they reach a certain weight threshold/height.

### How to fix it?

The first option is to increase the number of supports or the thickness of supports. Check the exposure times and change them to the recommended values.

The second option is to use the PrusaSlicer and [hollow out an object](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hollowing_117285), to reduce the weight and use less resin. **When hollowing out a model it is crucial that you create drainage holes**. Uncured resin can be trapped inside the part it can also create suction/vacuum on the bottom of the tank and the object cannot detach properly, upon layer change.

It is also possible to hollow out models using Meshmixer or Windows 3D Builder, but it will require you to export a model that you then open in PrusaSlicer.

---

# [Broken supports (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/broken-supports-sl1-sl1s_1792)

Broken supports (or missing parts of supports) are usually caused by incorrect settings in the PrusaSlicer. The supports are either too thin or the exposure time is set to a value too low. In some cases, this can be also caused by a dirty FEP film.

Try printing one of the sample objects to see whether the issue remains. If the sample object was printed without trouble, reset your PrusaSlicer settings.

If the sample object has the same sort of trouble, inspect the FEP film in the resin tank – it may be dirty. In very rare scenarios, a faulty UV LED panel can be the cause.

---

# [Skewed / deformed prints (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/skewed-deformed-prints-sl1-sl1s_1793)

A skewed/deformed print is usually caused by **loose screws** – either the **large black knob** at the top of the cantilever, the screw(s) on the cantilever itself or the **resin tank screws**.

### Solution

#### Cantilever screw(s)

Make sure the cantilever screw(s) is tightened up firmly. If not, the whole platform might shift and you must **redo the printer calibration**. After getting to the corresponding step of the calibration, follow the on-screen instructions. To ensure that the geometry of the printer is not shifted when tightening, **tighten the screw slowly but firmly.** To apply enough torque, **use the short end of the Allen wrench.** (as depicted below).

#### Knob and tank

Make sure the printer is properly calibrated. By moving the platform, ensure it is inserted all the way in. Tighten the black knob at the top of the tower. (left picture)

Also, tighten both resin tank screws evenly using the same amount of force (right picture).

---

# [Missing parts (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/missing-parts-sl1-sl1s_1794)

A print can finish even if some parts of the object weren’t printed fully, though a missing part of an object will more often cause the whole print-job to fail. Try printing a sample object to see whether it is also affected by this issue.

The warrior’s right arm is missing completely and a part of the shield is damaged

There are two main reasons (and a third, less common one) why printed objects may have missing parts. They both usually come down to incorrect slicer-settings.

#### **Lack of supports**

Please check the [SL1 Handbook](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/printer-handbooks_125045), chapter 6.5: Slicing objects for the SL1, to learn how to correctly position an object and generate supports for it. Keep in mind that parts of the object cannot start mid-air and that the printer has a threshold for overhangs.

Improve the supports in PrusaSlicer, re-slice the object, and try printing it again. If the problem persists, try printing a sample object and see if the problem is still present. If it is, there might be a problem with the printing display or UV LED panel.

#### **Incorrect exposure times**

If you set incorrect exposure times (especially too low times), the resin will not have enough time to solidify, which may result in missing details. Always make sure you’re using recommended exposure times for your prints.

Make sure you are using exposure times recommended for the resin of your choice.

#### **Faulty hardware**

Another possibility (a less common one) is that your print display or UV LED panel is faulty, so either the mask is incorrectly displayed or only a part of the object is cured by UV light. Please contact customer support if the previous steps did not solve the issue.

# [Visible layers (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/visible-layers-sl1-sl1s_1795)

Even though SLA printers can achieve much better resolution than standard FFF/FDM 3D printers, layers on objects can be still visible if you look very closely. If you feel like the layers on your prints are too visible, there’s a couple of things you can try.

Print a sample object with a good/tested resin (like the sample bottle of Prusa Orange) and see if the issue is still present. If it’s not, then the cause is usually related to slicing settings.

### Possible solutions

* Try rotating the object to eliminate gradually rising/declining surfaces.
* Extreme exposure times can also produce visible layers.
* Mixed / low-quality resins can also affect the print quality – use a fresh, high-quality resin and shake the bottle for at least 20 seconds before you pour the resin in the tank.

---

# [Warped layers (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/warped-layers-sl1-sl1s_1796)

Most resins have a tendency to shrink by several micrometers after they are cured. These expansions and resulting forces can lead to layer warping and layer separation. However, these errors are usually limited to large solid layers.

This printing error is caused by the physical properties of resins. Consider hollowing problematic objects, if you encounter layer warping.

Warping can also occur during drying and curing of thin and flat objects. Consider the orientation and position of supports to mitigate this. Sometimes it can be resolved by removing the print from the platform after it has been dried and cured.

---

# [Loud noises from printer (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/loud-noises-from-printer-sl1-sl1s_1797)

When your printer emits loud noises, sounding like hammering onto sheet-metal. This can be caused by a firmware issue, or if resin has leaked into your printer through the tilt platform.

A clogged (flooded) sensor of the tilt-mechanism can cause it to not move as intended.

First, check that your firmware is up to date. If you have the latest available version installed and the problem persists, remove the black cover and check whether the sensor under the tilt motor is clean. If there is resin on the sensor then remove it with a piece of paper towel and make sure the sensor is perfectly clean – otherwise, the reading will be affected.

---

# [Prints breaking away from the platform](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prints-breaking-away-from-the-platform_1798)

The printing platform must be perfectly flat and degreased to ensure that the first prints are properly attached. If the pad or print itselfs separates from the printing platform, it can be caused by bumps on the platform, poor calibration, or dirt/grease on the platform.

Make sure the

**platform is perfectly clean and degreased.**

Wash the entire platform in IPA carefully to ensure it is completely degreased.

**Consider re-calibrating the printer**

to make sure the platform is in good contact with the bottom of the tank.

It is possible to sand down the platform’s surface with a 1000-grit sandpaper, however, this procedure is **recommended only to experienced users** , since incorrect approach could damage the platform. Be gentle and make it even.

---

# [Print doesn't appear / Resin does not solidify](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/print-doesnt-appear-resin-does-not-solidify_1799)

If the print does not appear on the printing platform, nor at the bottom of the resin tank, there are a couple of possible causes:

* Highly insufficient exposure times
* Old or separated resin
* A large amount of Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in the resin/on platform
* Faulty UV LED panel,
* Faulty print display



### Insufficient/Incorrect exposure times

Make sure you are using the correct preset with the recommended exposure times for your resin, in PrusaSlicer. If your resin does not have a dedicated preset, use the [Resin Calibration (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/resin-calibration-sl1-sl1s_112182) to determine the correct values.

### Old or separated resin

If the resin is not stored correctly, or you use the same batch, again and again, it can lose its original properties and won’t solidify anymore. Try a new batch of resin if you kept re-using one batch several times.

If the resin remains in the vat for too long it can start separating its reactive components and its oil solution (notice the lines of color difference in the picture below). Even though the printer will stir the resin using its tilt platform it may not be sufficient. With a gloved finger or a spatula, carefully stir the resin until its color is uniform.

### A large amount of Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in the resin/on the platform

If the platform is still wet of IPA after cleaning when the print begins, the IPA will repel the resin and the print will not stick to the platform upon exposure. Make sure you wipe the platform dry before starting your print.

If a lot of IPA has dripped into the resin tank it can dilute the resin to the point where it will lose some of its properties. Empty the tank and try a new batch of resin.

### Faulty print display or UV LED panel

Check whether the UV panel and LCD screen work as intended – Run the Display test, found at _Settings - > Calibration-> Display test_ _._ Follow the onscreen instructions.

If the logo does not appear on the display, but it is lit from the back, check the display’s wiring. To do so, remove the black cover secured by eight screws, then inspect the cable leading from the exposition (print) display. You can carefully disconnect and reconnect the cable header from the mainboard to ensure that it is seated correctly.

If it remains completely dark may be due to a faulty UV LED panel. Check its wiring by unplugging it and plugging it back in, making sure the connector is seated properly. Test the display again and if it still does not work it will have to be replaced.

Make sure the cooling fan for the UV LED panel is working. Without it, both the UV LED panel and print display can overheat and be damaged.

---

# [Removing and object stuck to the bottom of the tank](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/removing-and-object-stuck-to-the-bottom-of-the-tank_1800)

In case the first layer did not stick to the printing platform, it would remain stuck at the bottom of the tank.

No matter how big or how small the stuck layer is, here is a quick safe way that will help you remove it from the FEP film, without damaging it:

1. Unscrew the resin tank screws and remove the tank
2. Take an empty bottle and insert the bundled funnel/filter in it
3. One of the tank corners has a different shape, use it to pour the resin from the tank into the bottle. Always pour used resin into a new bottle; don’t mix it with unused liquid – especially if the print failed.
4. Wipe the tank with a soft paper cloth. The layer that got stuck should be now fully visible
5. Keep the tank in a horizontal position and use your fingertips (as shown in the picture below) to detach the solidified layer from the bottom. Use a reasonable amount of force and don’t use your fingernails. If the layer is larger, start from the edges and use a circular motion to detach it evenly. You will usually hear the sound of the layer detaching from the FEP film – this indicates that it’s working.



Once the stuck object is removed, clean the printer and the tank and try printing a sample object. If the print fails again, re-run the calibration process. The most common cause of this issue is an incorrect Z-offset of the printing platform.

Using the plastic spatula that comes with the printer can assist in removing the hardened piece of resin.

Make sure there are no small pieces of the residue of hardened resin before you start another print!

# [Ghosting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ghosting_1801)

Ghosting can be typically recognized by several waves that follow after a sharp edge of a model. An example can be seen in the photograph of 3DBenchy at the marked spot.

### How to fix ghosting (MK2/2.5/S and MK3/S):

**Adjust belt tension on X and/or Y axes**. It may take a bit of time to find the perfect belt tension. We can offer the following tip: try plucking the belt like a guitar string. You should hear a deep bass tone. A belt that has been tightened more will emit a higher tone. A less tightened belt will result in a lower tone.

You can also check the **Belt Status values** which can be found in the printer’s LCD menu. Go to Support -> Belt Status and check the measured values. Values between 240 and 300 are fine. These values are updated each time you run the Selftest ( _LCD menu - > Calibration -> Selftest_), or that you run a belt test ( _LCD menu - > Calibration ->_ Belt test). A lower value means more belt tension, a higher value means a more loose belt. For more information about how to change the belt tension, check the guide [Adjusting belt tension (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+/MK3.5/MK4)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mk3-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5-mk4_112380).

### How to fix ghosting (MINI):

**Check the X/Y belts.** Make sure that belts are properly tightened. Belts should be tight enough to sound like a low bass note when plucked. If the belts are loose, tighten them first: first, loosen the two screws as depicted below. Then, tighten the two screws at the very end of the X-axis. They go directly against the metal rods, so the more tightened they are, the further you move the plastic part. Once you are done, tighten the first two screws again to fix the part in place. For more information about how to change the belt tension, check the guide [Adjusting belt tension (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mini-mini_157324).

### General advice:

The problem of ghosting can be visible also **when belts are properly tightened**. Ghosting is caused by vibrations that increase with print speed. To reduce ghosting, try to **reduce the printing speed** and see if the problem goes away. It’s always better to place the printer on a firm surface.

# [Poor bridging](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/poor-bridging_1802)

Bridging is a term for printing layers over thin air without the use of supports. It may sound like an impossible feat, but with our MK2 and MK3 printers, it’s not that difficult. Keep in mind that the best results are achieved only over short distances because the printer’s fans need to cool the extruded plastic mid-air in order to create a solid connection. There are three key settings for printing good looking bridged layers: PrusaSlicer settings, speed, and cooling.

**The typical problem of bridging layers is sagging or drooping as seen in the photo above.**

### **How to fix it**

To access some settings/parameters in PrusaSlicer, you must be in 'Advanced' or 'Expert' mode. You can switch to a different mode using the buttons in the right panel or by going to _Configuration - > Mode -> Simple/Advanced/Expert_. For more information please see [Simple, Advanced, Expert modes](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765).

The best way to prevent the layers from breaking in bridging mode is to change the “Bridging flow” setting in the PrusaSlicer. The first bridging layer should be done with a lower flow of the material. Open the settings in PrusaSlicer by right-clicking the model, then go to Object settings – Advanced – Bridge flow ratio. We recommend using lower speed for printing bridges and also lower bridging flow. The idea is to “pull” the string of extruded filament behind the nozzle, so it drops less. The ideal approach is to download bridging test models, for example, [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:476845) one, put it in the slicer several times, and set up a different flow for every model. This should be a relatively quick way how to find correct settings for your printer/material without the need to perform many test prints.

#### **Tweak the speeds in PrusaSlicer**

Right-click the object in the 3D view or click on the **Editing** icon in the Object list to open the context menu. Then select Add settings - Speed - Bridges and tweak the speed for printing bridges.

#### Enforce supports half-way through the bridge

If the bridge is very long, you can use support enforcers to create a support island half-way through. Right-click on the model in the 3D view and select Add support enforcer - Box. Then transform the box using the move, rotate and scale tools.

#### **Change the orientation of the object**

The best solution is to **change the orientation of the object** (rotate it) until you get rid of the bridges completely and you don’t have to worry about bridges or supports. It won’t be possible in many cases, but the rule of thumb here is to try to avoid bridges and supports completely.

# [Bad looking surface above supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/bad-looking-surface-above-supports_1803)

Generally speaking, it’s always the best option to rotate the object in such a way that the supports are not needed at all. However, if you need to print complex objects, you will end up using supports anyway. After you remove the support structure, you may notice that the surface above the supports looks worse than the rest of the print.

_The picture above shows the artifacts that can appear if print settings are not optimal_

### How to fix bad looking surface above supports

Again, try to **rotate the object in PrusaSlicer** and find a better orientation that would require fewer supports.

You may also consider using the [Cut tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cut-tool_1779), to print two parts more easily, which you then glue together.

### **Support settings**

In order to make the supports easier to break off from the printed object, a small gap is left between the support and the object’s surface. If you decrease the gap, you may get better results, but the supports may be more difficult to remove.

You can tweak the values for supports in PrusaSlicer, section _Print Settings – Support material_. Try fine-tuning Contact Z and Decrease pattern spacing to improve the quality of the surface.

Another good thing to try is to increase the number of interface layers to 3-4. You will have a more solid top-surface of your support, which can also make the contact-point of the support easier to remove.

# [First layer issues](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804)

This is by far the most common 3D printing problem, and probably the first one you may encounter. The first layer is the essential one because it is the base of the printed object. Therefore, if it isn’t perfect, the chance of print failure increases. Many common 3D printing problems stem from a poor first layer. There are a couple of things that can go wrong when printing your first layer, so let’s take a look at what can be done to avoid these problems.

The print surface should be regularly maintained to achieve optimal printing quality and minimize the chance of failed prints. It's an easy procedure, so let's take a look at our tips and recommendations.

### How to prepare your print surface

If you don't touch the print surface **with your hands or dirty tools,** then you don't have to clean it before every print. **Clean your tools the same way** you would the bed, and you will be able to start your next print right away.

#### Isopropyl alcohol

To achieve the best adhesion of the print surface, it is vital to keep it clean. **The best option** when printing with ABS, PLA, and many other materials is **90% Isopropyl alcohol,** which can usually be sourced locally at drugstores or hardware stores. **Denatured alcohol is also an option.** We recommend always using 90% IPA. Solutions with lower percentages may contain unsuitable chemicals and oils.

**PETG, ABS, ASA, XT, and CPH filaments are an exception** \- the adhesion may be too strong, and you can damage your Smooth PEI sheet. We recommend using a separating agent (e.g. a glue stick). For more information on how to print with these materials, check out our [Material guides](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/category/material-guide_220).

Any cleaning agent (e.g. IPA) that is dermal/cosmetic, i.e. for skin or nails, may contain additives like moisturizers and oils which are not suitable.

#### Dish soap and water

If the adhesion seems to decrease over time even when using IPA, you can clean the steel sheet with a few drops of **dish soap and warm water (not hot!)**. This should not be done often, and **do not submerge the sheet completely in hot water** , but it will dissolve some oils and sugars that gather over time and that IPA does not remove. Make sure to use only dish soap and dry the sheet well before using it.

#### Acetone

PEI can lose its adhesive powers after a couple of hundred hours. When you see models coming loose regularly, wipe the surface thoroughly with **acetone** to restore the adhesion. **This should only be used in the smooth PEI sheet and only around once per month.** Do not overuse **acetone.** Extended use makes PEI surface brittle. Also, do not use **acetone** before printing with PETG.

For the

**textured**

and the

**satin**

steel sheets,

**do not use acetone at all!**

Other chemical solvents, like Nail polish remover or brake-cleaner, can also contain acetone (acetates).

#### Glue

Glue is a great, easy-to-use tool to increase adhesion. It also creates a protective separation layer. No need for glue specially made for 3D printing. You can use a basic (PVA-based) glue stick. From our experience, it is not needed when printing PLA, but may it be advisable when printing:

You can easily wipe off PVA glue with

**dish soap and water**

.

Other types of glue should not be used as a substitute. **Don't put Superglue on your sheet!** When removing prints with a large surface area, you may have to assist the process using a spatula. Be gentle when flexing the sheet and removing the print as the smooth PEI foil can tear.

**In case you are using ABS juice, do not use it on the textured and satin steel sheets at all!**

#### Resurface it

It can happen that you will leave some small marks on the print surface with your nozzle or tools. Typically, they will be shinier than the rest of the pad. It does not affect functionality or adhesion. However, if you want to have the same surface look on the whole print bed, you can resurface it.

The easiest way is to take the hard side of a dry kitchen sponge and gently wipe the affected area in a circular motion a few times. Another option is to use fine-grit sandpaper (400-600) and lightly give the sheet a rub. Wipe over with IPA after doing so.

**Smooth PEI sheet**

* Isopropyl alcohol 90%+ (IPA) -best degreaser
* Warm water + few drops with
dish soap (in case IPA doesn’t
remove sugar residue on the
sheet)
* Acetone - once in a while to
rejuvenate the sheet

Use glue stick when printing FLEX, PETG, and other PET-based materials, as well as ABS and ASA.
IPA + PETG will cause the print to adhere very strongly to the sheet. Removing it could be extremely difficult.
**Textured powder-coated**
**sheet**

* Isopropyl alcohol 90%+ (IPA) -
best degreaser

**Never use acetone!**
**Satin powder-coated sheet**

* Isopropyl alcohol 90%+ (IPA) -
best degreaser

**Never use acetone!**

### The nozzle is too close/far from the sheet (MK2/MK2.5/MK3/MK3.5)

If the nozzle is too close to the printing bed, there won’t be enough room for the plastic to come out of the extruder. By having the nozzle too close to the print surface, you will essentially block its opening, so that no plastic can be extruded. You can easily recognize this issue when the printer does not extrude plastic for the first layer or two. Use the Live Adjust Z function and [First Layer Calibration (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364) options to tweak the height of the nozzle. You perform the calibration from _LCD Menu – > Calibration –> First layer calibration_. **For more information on this procedure, please see the dedicated article[First Layer Calibration (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364).**

**Avoid compensating for a lack of adhesion by setting a lower Live Adjust Z (squishing the first layer)**

.

**If lowered too much, the nozzle can damage the steel sheet and cause excessive vibrations.**

Any damage caused by incorrect Live Adjust Z value is not covered by the warranty.

### Speed and temperature

#### Decrease the printing speed

If the steps described above didn’t help, then try decreasing the printing speed. The easiest way how to do it is by rotating the knob during the printing process, lowering the percentage. **Counterclockwise = decrease speed** , **Clockwise = increase speed**. We suggest decreasing the speed to about 75% for the first three layers, and then returning it to normal.

#### Use recommended printing temperatures

Make sure to use the recommended nozzle and heatbed temperatures. PrusaSlicer will configure them correctly based on the selected material, so you don’t need to adjust the temperatures manually on the printer itself. If you are experimenting with new materials that don’t adhere well, you can try to increase the heatbed temperature by 5-10 °C. This way the plastic will stick a bit better.

### A full or partial clog

**The extruder could be clogged**. This can happen either when excessive debris gets stuck inside the nozzle, when hot plastic is kept inside the extruder for too long, or when the thermal cooling for the extruder is not sufficient and the filament begins to soften outside of the desired melt zone. **Please see our dedicated article[Clogged nozzle/hotend (MK3.5, MK3S+, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3-5-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008).**

### Uneven surface

If your print surface is not flat and the alignment of the mesh does not help, to achieve a flat print surface, a temporary solution is to add a piece of paper under the uneven area of the steel sheet. **A more permanent solution would be to perform the firmware[Bed Level Correction](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/bed-level-correction_2267).**

#### Correctly placed sheet

Before printing, make sure that you have the print plate properly installed, and that there are no leftovers from the previous print or a piece of loose filament that could affect the sheet position. Also, make sure that the sheet is straight and not bent or damaged.

### Brim

Before you consider applying extra adhesion materials onto the bed, consider using the **Brim option** in PrusaSlicer, which increases the surface area of the first layer. **See our dedicated article[Skirt and Brim](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/skirt-and-brim_133969#brim).**

### Expansion joints (MK4, MK3.9, MK3.5)

On the Original Prusa MK4, having the Magiboxes in the wrong orientation can cause an uneven first layer. Make sure that all of them have the full side facing the center of the carriage.

### Nozzle conditions (MK4, MK3.9, XL)

The nozzle on the Nextruder has to be at the correct height. If you are not sure if the height is correct, open the thumb screws on the side of the heatbreak, and push the nozzle up. Tighten the thumb screws just by hand, do not use any tools.

If you have a [Nozzle Adapter](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-install-the-nextruder-v6-nozzle-adapter-mk4-mk3-9_416174), check the installation again to make sure that the nozzle has not been lowered with the installation of the adapter.

### LoadCell check (MK4, MK3.9, XL)

If the filament is loaded while the printer is doing the leveling at the start of a print, check if the extruder is not pulling the filament down by loosening the filament spool a little. If you have the filament being fed by a PTFE tube, make sure that the tube is not short.

After the previous checks, go into the printer menu to _Control - > Calibrations & tests -> 4\. Loadcell test_, and make the LoadCell test per screen instructions.

### Mechanical checks (XL)

#### Core XY

If your first layer is showing one side higher than the others on the Original Prusa XL, check the assembly of the Core for any loose screws which hold the Core to the four extrusions. Also, use the [torque indicator](https://www.printables.com/model/449554-xl-printable-parts/files#preview:file-YmfJL) to make sure the screws are tightened correctly.

#### Heatbed Tiles

Check if any of the screws under each heatbed tiles are loose.

#### Z-axis bearing housing

Re-print the two [Z axis bearing housing](https://www.printables.com/model/449554-xl-printable-parts/files#preview:file-cr9Wx) parts, and replace them in the printer.

# [Stringing and oozing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/stringing-and-oozing_1805)

Stringing or oozing, also known as "hairy prints", is the name given for when small strings of filament are left on a printed model. This usually happens when the filament keeps flowing from the nozzle while the extruder is moving to another object. You can see this as a marginal line of filament left between the objects.

This issue is caused by **very high printing temperatures and/or using incorrect retraction settings**. This can be solved by changing a couple of settings in PrusaSlicer and checking your hardware.

### Stringing from material left on the nozzle

If you print for a long time from a single type of filament, such as PET-G, the filament can create a thin layer in the nozzle. This can cause stringing as the strands of the filament stick to the surface of the print. Therefore, thoroughly clean the nozzle before printing and make sure that any dirt or remnants of previous filaments are removed from the nozzle.

We highly recommend using our official (factory default) preset settings in PrusaSlicer. However, if you are printing with your own settings, make sure that you have the retraction settings configured correctly.

### PrusaSlicer settings

You should start by checking a parameter known as Retraction. What does retraction do? When the extruder has finished printing one section/object of your g-code, the filament is pulled back into the nozzle. Once the extruder moves to the next location the printing process continues – the filament is pushed back out and it starts extruding from the nozzle again. Retraction settings can be found in PrusaSlicer in _Printer Settings - > Extruder 1_.

Flexible filaments usually need longer retractions, because the material stretches while being pulled back to the nozzle. Flexible materials are a special case and can need a lot of tweaking and tuning.

**The retraction settings are:**

* **Retraction length:** Amount that the filament is pulled back when a retraction is triggered. **On the MK2.5/S and MK3/S/+, the retraction length should be a maximum of 2 mm.**



Due to the Bowden extruder, the retraction length of the Original Prusa MINI/MINI+ presets are much longer (default 3.2 mm).

* **Lift z:** lifts the extruder during movement. Having this setting lower will improve stringing. Note that disabling this feature may cause the nozzle to hit the printed part. **
**
* **Retraction Speed:** Extruder motor speed on retraction. A higher value improves stringing, but if it is too high it may skip steps in the motor.
* **Minimum travel after retraction:** Amount of move that will trigger a retraction (mm). The preset number in PrusaSlicer is 1 mm, which is a low amount. Having this number higher will get lower printing times, but increase oozing and stringing.
* **Retract on layer change:** Activates retraction when the layer changes to the next one. It is recommended to leave this option on.
* **Wipe while retracting:** Moves the nozzle (wipe) while the retraction is happening. It is recommended to leave this option on.
* **Retract amount before wiping:** This option does a quick retract before doing the wiping movement. More suitable for the Original Prusa MINI/MINI+.



**Other settings that affect retraction:**

* **Only retract when crossing perimeters:** _(Print settings - > Infill -> Advanced):_ Disables retraction when the travel path does not exceed the upper layer's perimeter. Any oozing that happens will be within the walls and should be invisible.
* **Avoid crossing perimeters:** _(Print settings - > Layers and perimeters -> Quality):_ Optimize travel moves in order to minimize the crossing of perimeters. This will lower the stringing amount, especially in the MINI/MINI+.
* **[Sequential printing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sequential-printing_124589):** _(Print settings - > Output options -> Sequential printing):_ Printing each object individually has a smaller chance of causing stringing between the parts. When using this feature, PrusaSlicer will warn you of any possibility of the extruder colliding with an already printed part, but follow the print closely.
* **Nozzle temperature:** _(Filament settings - > Filament -> Nozzle):_ Lowering the temperature decreases the occurrence of strings. Try decreasing the nozzle temperature by 5 – 10°C and check whether there’s less stringing.



### Filament

Try using a different spool than the one that is causing the stringing. The filament might have gathered moisture, which will cause a lot of stringing.

### Hotend

Stringing in the nozzle might be caused by a heat dissipation issue in the nozzle. Try [re-applying thermal paste](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbreak-heatsink-heaterblock-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_16104) on the threads between the heatbreak and the heatsink.

If you have recently changed any component in the hotend, it is also possible that some individual parts are not in place. Go over the assembly of the hotend and check for any parts that may be different from the [instructions](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbreak-heatsink-heaterblock-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_16104).

### Enough settings, pass me my **heat-gun!**

If you don’t feel like tweaking any of the settings, well, then there is an alternative. You can get rid of the strings with a heat gun (or often with a lighter – but be very careful). Set your heat-gun to around 200 °C and aim at the strings for one or two seconds. This will melt the strings, and the printed object should remain undamaged. Do not leave the heat source on the printed model for longer than one or two seconds, as this may deform the part.

# [Layer separation and splitting FDM](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layer-separation-and-splitting-fdm_1806)

This refers to the de-lamination of the printed layers. It is mostly caused by an incorrect preset/(custom)profile with wrong temperatures and/or too much cooling from either the print fan or the sorrounding environment.

Layer-separation is more an issue from the "old days" of unheated print-beds and less accessible materials, past ABS. This is rarely an issue on the MK-series hardware with PrusaSlicer presets, especially with materials like PLA and PETG.

It’s not difficult to tell the difference between cracking and missing layers. Best way to identify cracked layers are the clean cuts that show a bit of an upward bend or warp.

Layer separation occurs when the object cracks due to forces exerted on the print when layers cool down at different rates. Warping forces exceed the layer adhesion strength and the layers separate.

### **How to prevent Layer separation and Splitting**

ABS is highly susceptible to layer separation when there’s any sort of cold air blowing on the print before it has cooled down fully. We suggest turning fans OFF for ABS prints completely.

Please remember that you may probably not be able to print objects covering the whole print area using ABS, so it is better to replace ABS with PETG filament. PETG has similar advantages ABS, but it’s much better for printing large objects and it does not have the same tendency to crack/de-laminate. ASA is also a great alternative but is still more dependent on a stable environment when printing than PETG. You can check the [material guides](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/category/material-guide_220) for choosing the best material for your print.

PLA may suffer from cracking and layer separation problems if you’re printing with insufficient temperature. Depending on the brand, PLA is printed at a range between 195-220. If you are having issues, **try increasing the printing temperature in 5°C increments, until you get a good layer adhesion.**

### Flow-rate / extrusion multiplier

Increase your printer’s flow rate (in PrusaSlicer called extrusion multiplier). More material extruded will create a stronger bond between layers. increase on 5% increments. For more info please see [Extrusion multiplier calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extrusion-multiplier-calibration_2257).

Extrusion-multiplier is located where you set temperatures, but only accessible when PrusaSlicer is set to Advanced- or Expert-mode

# [Failing supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/failing-supports_1807)

Supports are an important part of a 3D printed object, especially when you need to print complex models. So when the supports fail (break) like in the picture above, it usually affects the rest of the print. Most often, the print won’t finish successfully.

Supporting pillars, especially when using low support density, can be quite fragile and not very stable things. The taller (and thinner) the supports, the higher the danger of failure.

In places where you have big overhangs, supports should be added. Although some overhangs can be printed without supports, in many cases supports are required and the print won’t finish successfully without them. For overhang tests, you can download STL models from our platform [here](https://www.prusaprinters.org/search/all?q=overhang%20test).

### **How to prevent failing supports**

* **Avoid isolated support towers** , [Cut printed objects](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cut-tool_1779) to more parts.
* Reduce printing speed for supports in PrusaSlicer, section **Print settings – Speed**
* Use a [Brim](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/skirt-and-brim_133969) around our support, found within **Print settings – Skirt and Brim**
* Use a different 'pattern' of the support. in PrusaSlicer, section **Print setting – Support material – Pattern.**
* Change the value of the Overhang Threshold. The Overhang threshold value represents the most horizontal slope (measured from the horizontal plane) that you can print without support material (90=vertical).
* Use [custom supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/modifier-meshes-custom-supports-and-other-magic_114258), tailored to your model.

# [ASA](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/asa_1809)

### Basic info

**ASA** is a technical material **suitable for outdoor use** , due to its high UV light and temperature resistance. Unlike other materials soluble in more dangerous chemicals, **ASA can be dissolved in acetone.** The main disadvantage of this material is significant warping, which requires printing at higher ambient temperatures.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 260 °C

**Recommended bed temperature:** 105 °C for the first layer, 110 °C for the other layers.

**Heatbed: Use the smooth or powder-coated PEI sheet with a glue stick.**

### Description

[**ASA**](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/prusament-asa/) (Acrylic Styrene Acrylonitrile) is a technical material that is considered a **successor to ABS**. Compared to ABS, **ASA is more UV resistant, warps less, and doesn’t smell as much.** ASA is a tough and resilient material that is, thanks to its UV and temperature resistance (up to 93 °C), **suitable for outdoor use** and for making technical parts. See for example our **MK3S printer** [**fan shroud.**](https://www.prusa3d.com/cs/produkt/fan-shroud-bl-mk3s-mmu2s-mk2-5s/) Another great advantage of ASA is its **solubility in acetone vapors** , which can be used to make a smooth and glossy finish. This gives the model not only great looks but also different mechanical properties (see our [article about chemical smoothing](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/improve-your-3d-prints-with-chemical-smoothing_36268/)).

The main disadvantage of ASA is **significant warping** caused by temperature differences between the model and its surroundings. Another disadvantage is that ASA releases potentially dangerous fumes during printing - this means you should keep your printer in a well-ventilated area. ASA can be easily sanded both wet and dry.

ASA printing requires specific conditions for successful results. It’s important to run the prints in a well-ventilated room because the material releases fumes and substances that could pose a potential health risk. However, when ventilating the room, do not create a draft around the print – this will negatively impact the result.

You can find more details about how to print with ASA in [our in-depth article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/asa-prusament-is-here-learn-everything-about-the-successor-to-abs/).

And to compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ High temperature-resistance

✖ An enclosure is necessary for printing large parts

✔ Detailed prints with no stringing

✖ Potentially dangerous fumes (styrene)

✔ Possibility of acetone smoothing and gluing

✖ Prints at high temperatures

✔ Easy postprocessing (e.g. sanding, cutting, etc.)

✖ Partially hygroscopic (absorbs moisture)

✔ High impact and wear resistance

### Best use

**ASA** is suitable for outdoor use and for making technical parts.

### Tips for successful printing

**Try to keep a high ambient temperature**

The bed should be heated to at least **100 °C** , and the printer should be inside an enclosure to keep a higher ambient temperature. If you don’t have an enclosure, there’s one simple alternative: in [**PrusaSlicer**](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/), set the skirt value as high as possible. This will create a wall around the object and keep the model slightly warmer, mitigating the warping. Keep in mind that printing a lot of ASA in an unventilated enclosure can cause the fan shroud and/or extruder plastic parts to deform over time. This may impact performance or cause issues.

**ASA sticks very well to our print sheets** (smooth and powder coated) but other print surfaces, like glass, might require a layer of acetone with dissolved ASA (or [ABS](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/abs_2058)). If you print with [**MMU2S**](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mmu2s-upgrade-kit-for-mk2-5-mk3s-org/), you can use [**HIPS**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hips_167118) for printing supports - this material has similar print settings to ASA and can be easily dissolved in limonene.

Do not put acetone or ABS/ASA juice on the powder-coated sheet!

### **Chemical smoothing**

ASA is a pretty good material for postprocessing. Not only you can **sand it wet and dry** but you can also **glue/weld it with acetone** and **smooth it with acetone vapors.** Smoothed models have a glossy surface that looks like it’s treated with car lacquer or was injection molded. However, printed objects usually tend to lose detail and sharp edges with smoothing. You can find out more about chemical smoothing in [article about chemical smoothing](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/improve-your-3d-prints-with-chemical-smoothing_36268/).

# [TMC driver overtemp](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tmc-driver-overtemp_1813)

This error refers to the **T** rina **M** i **C** motor- **drivers** on the Einsy Rambo-board. They are the square chips located near the ports for the X, Y, Z, and E-motors on the Einsy RAMBo (Circled in red in the picture below). The error could be caused by a faulty chip and the board needs to be replaced, but not always. There are a couple of things you should check before contacting support.

### What to check

#### Ambient temperature

Check the Ambient- temperature. The sensor is located on the board. On the LCD-menu, navigate to _Support - > Temperatures -> Ambient._ It is normal that this is higher than your ambient temperature (room temperature), when not printing, but should not exceed 60-70C.

1. The error can occur with a fully functional printer **in an enclosure**. If so, you need to **check your ventilation-solution.**



#### Dirty/dusty board

Check that the board, and more specifically the drivers are not full of dust and grease. Wipe them down with IPA 91% on a cotton-stick if they are.

#### Firmware bug

Pretty simple - Flash the firmware-again.

#### Custom firmware and GCODES

These can unknowingly increase the current to the motors over its recommended specifications, triggering this error. If you have any modifications installed that implements either, this is the place to start looking.

#### Wiring issue/ Short Circuit

A short circuit or fast voltage dip on, for example, a fan bus and/or possibly the 5-volt mainline. Check Soldering points on the print fan, and pay attention if the error appears when the fan is initiated, or upon the activation of any other non-integrated component.

### The naming of printable parts

To know the origin of our printable parts, we are using naming which always starts with **an alphabetical letter** and is followed by a **number** :

* **C# D#** \- MK3S/MK3S+ parts produced in our 3D printing farm, which are sent to our customers with Kits or pre-assembled printers.
* **F#** \- MINI / MINI+ parts, farm printed.
* **M#** \- MMU2S parts, farm printed.
* **S#** \- SL1 / CW1 parts, farm printed.
* **R#** \- Parts that can be found at [Prusa Research profile at PrusaPrinters](https://www.prusaprinters.org/social/16-prusa-research/collections/54487), [Prusa3D site](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusa-i3-printable-parts/) or our [Github](http://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3). These are the parts you can print yourself.



Each letter of the alphabet is only used 9 times. For example, once we reached C9, the next revision was named D1.

# [File incomplete. Continue anyway?](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/file-incomplete-continue-anyway_1847)

**Our printers can detect a corrupted file on the SD card.** The error message "File incomplete. Continue anyway?" occurs when there is a problem with the generated G-code and it could potentially fail the whole print.

The printer automatically looks for common G-codes which indicate the end of the generated file. If they are not detected, you will get a warning. You can still continue printing if you wish, but you should probably examine the file.

### Troubleshooting

There are several things that could be the cause of this error. Please check the points below to determine which.

1. Make sure that you have exported the G-code in-full to your computer or SD card.
2. Double-check that you did not delete any of the **start and end** G **-** code found in PrusaSlicer (picture below).
3. Try to **Safely Remove** the SD card from your computer, otherwise, you may end up with corrupt data.
4. Remove any special characters or letters from the file name of your G-code (letters with diacritics, symbols like apostrophes or non-basic Latin alphabet, like "Å, Æ, Ø, Ä, Ö, etc.).
5. The error can present itself if the SD card is removed during the initial loading when starting a print. If not accidental, this could indicate an issue with the SD card slot in the LCD module, if it happens on all gcodes.
6. Your SD card could be corrupted. Please try to [Format the SD card](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sd-cards-and-usb-drives_112291#how-do-i-format-the-usb-drive-sd-card) or use another SD card to test if this is the cause of the problem.

# [Install PrusaSlicer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/install-prusaslicer_1903)

### Windows

A stand-alone **EXE** installer of the latest stable release can be downloaded from [PrusaSlicer introduction & download](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) or [our Github](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases).

When downloading from Github, make sure you download the correct file for your computer. For Windows, it will be a .zip file, with "Win32" or "Win64" in the title. Most computers these days are 64-bit, which will run the 32-bit version as well. If you have an old computer, you may want to get the Win32 version.

The [ Drivers & Apps installation package](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) includes the PrusaSlicer itself but also sets of test objects and printer drivers. These are optional, you can choose to install only PrusaSlicer.

Check out

[Download PrusaSlicer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/download-prusaslicer_2220)

for download and testing of Alpha and Beta versions of PrusaSlicer, across all platforms.

### Mac

A stand-alone **DMG** installer of the latest stable release can be downloaded from [PrusaSlicer introduction & download](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) or [our Github](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases).

When downloading from Github, make sure you download the correct file for your computer. For Mac it will be the DMG file, which is 64-bit.

The [ Drivers & Apps installation package](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) includes the PrusaSlicer itself but also sets of test objects and printer drivers. These are optional, you can choose to install only PrusaSlicer.

To install any of these packages, just Drag and Drop it in the installer window.

### Linux

A stand-alone **AppImage** of the latest stable release can be downloaded from [PrusaSlicer introduction & download](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) or [our Github](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases). Extract the zip file containing an AppImage file. If you download from Github you will just get an AppImage file. You will then have to make the AppImage file executable to start PrusaSlicer. Exactly how this is done varies a little from distro to distro.

Pre-compiled PrusaSlicer is also available through all major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora / CentOS, SuSE, Arch Linux), as FlatPak or Snap image. While we at PrusaSlicer are thankful to the contributors, these distribution channels are not officially tested by PrusaResearch thus not guaranteed to be working or up to date. More information about Linux binary distributions can be found here: [PrusaSlicer on Linux binary distributions](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/wiki/PrusaSlicer-on-Linux***binary-distributions)

#### How to make Appimage files executable

Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and MX Linux are three popular distros of Linux. All you need to do is to locate the AppImage file, right-click it, and select Properties. In the new menu that appears, select Permissions and tick "Allow executing file as program", or a variation of this (green square), to make the file executable. Close properties and you should now be able to double-click the icon to start PrusaSlicer.

_Ubuntu 20.04_ _MX Linux 19.2_ _Linux Mint 20 Cinnamon_

#### From terminal

Another way of making a file executable across most distros is by using the Terminal/Console. Enter the directory where you extracted the AppImage file. The example below is using the "Downloads" folder.

List the files in that directory to copy the exact name of the file.


chmod a+x PrusaSlicer-exact-file-name.AppImage

To start PrusaSlicer, run the command below from Terminal, or double-click the file in your desktop environment.


./PrusaSlicer-exact-file-name.AppImage

### Chromebook

We expect the current version of Chrome OS with Debian 10.7 or newer.

First, you'll have to enable Linux on your Chromebook:

1. Go to Settings
2. Click the Menu icon ☰ in the top left corner
3. Select Linux (beta)
4. Click **Turn on** and confirm by clicking on the **Install** button



Then you can proceed to PrusaSlicer installation:

1.     1. A stand-alone AppImage of the latest stable release can be downloaded from [PrusaSlicer introduction & download](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) or [our Github](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases).
2. Copy the AppImage to the 'Linux Files folder'
3. (This step is not necessary with the latest ChromeOS)
Open Terminal and insert the following command to install a file system software:

sudo apt-get install fuse

4. Open Terminal and insert the following command to install missing libraries

sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa libpangoxft-1.0

5. Run the following command to make the .appimage file executable.

chmod a+x PrusaSlicer-exact-file-name.AppImage

6. Run the following command to start PrusaSlicer. Type this every time in the terminal to run it.

./PrusaSlicer-exact-file-name.AppImage




### Troubleshooting Linux/ChromeOS

A fresh installation of the mentioned distros may not have all dependencies required. If you are getting any errors while using PrusaSlicer, you can check if there are any missing libraries by starting it from Terminal. If you get an error, you're likely missing a library that PrusaSlicer uses, for example:


error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

#### Solution

Enter the directory where you extracted the Zip file with the AppImage. The example below is using the Downloads folder. _This approach requires you have already made the program executable, as described above._

List the files in that directory to copy the exact name of the file.

Run the AppImage while in the directory


./PrusaSlicer-exact-file-name.AppImage

If you get an error, you can solve the problem by installing the missing library. What may be missing depends on which distro and desktop environment you are using. **Use your favorite search engine and search for how to install the missing library/dependency on your system.** _You can also get an error in Terminal, but PrusaSlicer will run without any issues._


sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module

# [General info](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/general-info_1910)

### Welcome to PrusaSlicer documentation (PrusaSlicer manual)

PrusaSlicer (formerly known as Slic3r Prusa Edition or Slic3r PE) is our own in-house developed slicer software based on the open-source project [**Slic3r**](https://slic3r.org/). PrusaSlicer is an open-source, feature-rich, frequently updated tool that contains everything you need to export the perfect print files for (not only) your Original Prusa 3D printer.

PrusaSlicer is available for [Windows, Mac and Linux](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/download-prusaslicer_2220)

### History

The Slic3r project was born in 2011 within the RepRap community as an effort to provide the growing 3D printing technology under the leadership of **Alessandro Ranellucci** an open-source slicer. Slic3r spread among users quickly. When Josef Prusa was looking for a leading slicing software for Original Prusa printers the choice fell on Slic3r. It was (and still is) an open-source and very powerful software.

_Jo and Alessandro in 2012 ([video interview](https://youtu.be/Tuxg2L7r1oI))_

However, as Prusa Research was growing (very, very, very fast), we needed to be more flexible with the slicing software development. We needed to make changes to the software, and the changes had to be done asap. We also needed to add more features. At this point the co-operation with the detached original Slic3r team was unsustainable. The bottom line is that we decided to establish a fork of the original Slic3r project.

Slic3r Prusa Edition was released in November 2016 – [read more about the launch here](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/introducing-slic3r-prusa-edition_4650/). A dedicated team of full-time Slic3r PE developers was established and new functions were being added rapidly. These changes culminated in May 2019, when we released a new version with a major UI overhaul under a new name - [PrusaSlicer 2.0](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/prusaslicer-2-release_30008/).

Why the name change? First of all, the old name was really confusing. Even in our own materials, we often didn’t include the “PE” suffix, and the community used Slic3r and Slic3r PE pretty much interchangeably. New users could mistakingly download Slic3r and wonder why it looks different from the screenshots in the 3D Printing Handbook and why it’s not configured for their Prusa printer. Speaking about the original Slic3r: with each update, Slic3r PE was moving further and further away from its original code. We’ve rewritten all of the Perl source code into C++ and especially with the 2.0 update, there were so many differences that it seemed appropriate to make the name more distinct.

Of course, it’s still open-source and you’ll find everything on our [GitHub](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer). **And we’re still proud that our slicer is based on the[original project written by Alessandro Ranellucci](https://slic3r.org/)!** Both projects now happily coexist and new features are frequently merged between one and another.

# [Move, Rotate, Scale tools](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/move-rotate-scale-tools_1914)

### Move

Objects can be moved by left-mouse drag even when the move tool is inactive. Enabling the Move tool M displays a 3D gizmo, which lets the user adjust the object’s position in the X, Y or Z-axis.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

### Rotate

The Rotate tool ( **R** ) displays a 3D gizmo, which lets the user rotate the object around the X, Y or Z-axis. As soon as the user grabs one of the axes handles, two sets of white circular guidelines appear. Hovering the mouse over these guidelines will change the rotation from smooth to discrete steps.

* Outer circle / short marks 5-degree increments
* Inner circle / long marks 45-degree increments



Your browser does not support the video tag.

### Scale

The Scale tool (S) displays a 3D gizmo, which lets the user scale the object either uniformly, by grabbing one of the corner boxes, or non-uniformly, grabbing the X, Y or Z-axis handle.

By default, scaling is symmetrical, both sides of the model expand uniformly and the center stays in place. Holding down the Ctrl key before grabbing one of the X, Y or Z handles switches the mode to non-symmetrical.

* 5% increments Shift
* Scale to fit (maximum size) F
* only with the scale tool selected



Your browser does not support the video tag.

### Moving an object below the print bed

An object can be moved below the print bed to print just the part of the object above the print bed.

You can achieve a similar result with the Cut tool. However, using the move tool is arguably simpler to use, non-destructive, and very handy, for example, if you just need to flatten the bottom of an uneven object to be printable without a raft. The “Drop to bed” button in the object manipulation panel can be used to move the object back to the print bed, so it's no longer sinking below it. The intersection of the model with the bed is visualized with a white outline. Moving objects below the print bed is not allowed in SLA mode, for now. It would make the placement of SLA supports confusing.

### Moving an object above the print bed

We have a [standalone article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-lift-object-from-the-print-bed_245192) about how to do this.

# [Pouring resin and starting print](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pouring-resin-and-starting-print_1916)

### Pouring resin into the tank

Before you start printing, always make sure the FEP film on the bottom is clear (transparent), clean, and has no holes, dents, or deep scratches. Check the tilt platform with the display and make sure it is completely clean and there is no debris anywhere.

Wear gloves when handling resins!

Place the tank on the tilt platform. There is a small groove running around the tilt bed that will help you to position the tank properly. You may hear a little “click” as it falls into place. Use the two resin tank screws to secure it to the tilt bed. Tighten screws simultaneously and with the same amount of force, otherwise, the tank may end up in an uneven position.

Tighten both screws simultaneously and with the same amount of force. Pour the recommended amount of resin - there is a max level mark in the tank.

Once the tank is secure, pour the resin in it. Notice that there is a max level mark in the tank that will help you measure the optimal volume. The SL1 features a built-in resin level sensor, so in case there’s too little or too much resin, the printer will pause and display an on-screen info message. Please follow the on-screen instructions to fix the issue.

**Do not overfill the tank!**

Any time you are asked to refill the resin to the max, it always means adding it up to the 100% mark, not to the edge of the tank!

## Running out of resin / Adding resin mid-print

The SL1 features a built-in resin level sensor, which measures the amount of resin in the tank before every print. Some models might be too large and require more than the maximum amount of 200 ml resin in the tank. The printer can recognize when the resin starts running low and pauses the print. An on-screen message is displayed, asking you to fill resin back to the max level mark. Once you refill the resin, you can press the on-screen Continue button to resume the print.

Keep in mind that in certain cases (especially if the print has been paused for a long time), the new layer may not adhere perfectly to the rest of the object - or not adhere at all.

# [Factory reset (MMU2S pre firmware 1.0.6)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mmu2s-pre-firmware-1-0-6_1920)

As the MMU unit has its own separate logic board, it also has its separate firmware that is cooperating with the printer firmware. This MMU-specific firmware is flashed directly to the MMU2S unit, using the micro USB port.

The firmware for the MMU2S unit is

[available here](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/)

. The .zip package contains one MK3S+MMU2S firmware file, all possible MK2.5S+MMU2S firmware files, and

**one MMU firmware file**

.

On the right side of the MMU unit, there is a reset button. You can push it with an Allen key or with a similar thin, hard object. This button serves as a soft reset: it makes the MMU go through the initialization sequence and makes the selector return to the default position. This button **does not** serve for factory reset.

### Factory resetting the MMU2S firmware

Note that the factory reset is a **hard reset** of the MMU firmware: it will delete the filament length calibration values. The MMU2S will calibrate the filament length automatically and store this value. The firmware version will not be changed.

The procedure of entering the service menu and of factory resetting has changed a few times.

**The process described below works for MMU firmware version 1.0.5. and higher.**

It is not necessary anymore to observe or wait for the initialization sequence.

You can find out your firmware version number by navigating to

_**LCD menu - > Support**_

and scrolling down until you see

**MMU2 connected, FW:**

[firmware number

**]**

1. The printer and the MMU must be on. **Press and release the printer reset button** (marked X and positioned under the control knob on the LCD panel).
2. **Immediately** after releasing the X button, press the middle black button on the MMU unit and hold it.
3. Release the button **only** when in the first LED position, both the green and the red LEDs are on, and at the same time, in the fifth LED position, the red LED is on. See the photo below.


4. You have now entered the Service menu. Click the **left MMU button** 3 times. The red light at the fifth position will move to the second position, while the red and green lights in the first position will still be on.


5. Press (click) the **middle button**. This will unlock the MMU EEPROM erase function. There is no visual confirmation of that.
6. Press the **right button** once to select the LED n. 3. This means the red light will now move from the second position to the third position, while the red and green lights in the first position will still be on.


7. Press the middle button. This will definitely erase the MMU EEPROM. The process takes a while.
8. Wait until the board erases its memory and restarts itself. All LEDs will flash once, then the first LED will turn green. The board is now erased and ready.

# [Blown Fuse (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_1925)

The Original Prusa i3 MK3 series printers are equipped with fuses to protect their crucial components. If your printer or some of its components suddenly stopped working, it is recommended to check these fuses and replace them if necessary.

### Einsy RAMBo board

The MK3 series has a 24V Einsy RAMBo board. Just like its predecessor, this logic board has three removable **automotive fuses**.

The fuses we use are known as **ATO blade fuses** for automotive applications and can be found at any local car parts/hardware store or ordered online. It's a good practice to bring the blown fuse with you so that you can get the same one.

**Each fuse protects a different part of the board:**

* **F1 (5A fuse) -** Motors + logic unit + fans
* **F2 (5A fuse) -** Extruder Heater
* **F3 (15A fuse)** \- Bed heating



### Checking the Einsy RAMBo fuses

1. **Turn the printer off** and **disconnect the power cord.**
2. Open the electronics cover by removing the long M3x40 screw, holding the cover door closed. You may refer to [Electronics assembly - Finalizing the Einsy-case](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-electronics-assembly_34416#35992) of the assembly manual for more details.
3. Now you have access to the Einsy RAMBo. **Pull the fuses out** and inspect them. The photo below shows what the intact fuses look like. Inspect them from this angle and see if the little wire inside is not broken. In case you cannot tell if the fuse is broken, replace the fuse preventively.

If you own a multimeter, you can check the components for a potential short.

[Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117)

will show you how.




### PSU fuse

There are two versions of printer PSU. One is a silver PSU that uses a **T5AL250V 20mm fuse (slow)** , and the other is the Delta PSU (black one) that uses an **F8AH250V 20mm fuse (fast)**. You can check the pictures below for how to find the fuse in your PSU.

When you are replacing the fuse, make sure that the printer is turned off and disconnected from the power source.

* **Find the PSU fuse** , which is located just above the PSU's power plug.
* **Remove the cover of the PSU fuse** , the best tool for that is the screwdriver that comes bundled with our printer.
* **Inspect if the wire inside of the fuse is intact.** If it is damaged, then it must be replaced.



#### Delta PSU

#### Silver PSU

### Replacing blown fuses

1. **Turn the printer off, disconnect the power** and remove the blown fuse(s) from their sockets.
2. Place the new fuse in the correct slot - **Double check that you are replacing 5A for 5A or 15A for 15A if changing it on the Einsy RAMBo.**
3. **Unplug any components** connected to the previously blown fuse and try to turn on your printer. Check for any kind of unwanted behavior.
4. Once again, turn off the printer and remove the power cord. Then **reconnect all the disconnected components**.

# [FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/faq-frequently-asked-questions_1932)

### How do I get the kit or assembled printer owner discount?

As stated on our website: [Prusa3D](https://www.prusa3d.com), if you purchase an assembled MK3S+ printer, we offer a 10% discount on your upcoming five subsequent purchases of an **assembled printer of the same type** and on 30 spools of selected filaments per year **(not applicable to the** **MK4** ). If you choose to purchase your printer as a kit, we offer a 5% discount on 30 spools of selected filaments per year. In both cases, the discount is automatically activated in your account as soon as your first kit or printer is shipped.

### Can I have my printer signed by Jo?

Yes, Josef can sign the machined aluminum card, which can then be attached to the printer in your preferred location, but please know it can delay the expedition for over a month. He is very busy these days. If it's OK with you, you can ask for the signature in an email or via Live Chat.

### What are the printer dimensions?

The dimensions are (W×L×H or X×Y×Z):

* An assembled **Mini** printer has 12.6 × 13 × 15 inch / 320 × 330 × 380 mm and 5 kg
* Mini print area: 7×7×7 inch / 180 × 180 × 180 mm


* An assembled **SL1** printer has 8.7 × 9.45 × 16.3 inch / 220 × 240 × 415 mm and 11 kg
* SL1 print area: 4.7 × 2.6 × 5.9 inch / 120 × 68 × 150 mm


* An assembled **i3** (MK2/3) printer itself has 16.5 × 16.5 × 15 inches / 420 × 420 × 380 mm and 7 kg
* MK3/S print area: 9.8 × 8.2 × 8.2 inches / 250 × 210 × 210 mm



Keep in mind that the mini and all i3 printers need some more space when in use. Especially in front of and behind them, as the heatbed is moving outside their footprint. Count with 19.7 × 21.5 × 21.5 inches / 500 × 550 × 450 mm (400 × 450 × 450 mm for the Mini), without the spool or MMU.

If you are building an enclosure, you can add even more space in every direction, for better access and manipulation. For the MMU, add 150 mm / 6 in, in height, and think about

[where to put the 5 spools](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/spool-placement_112035)

(behind the printer or above).

### What is the printing precision/tolerance of the Original Prusa?

According to our testing, the precision tolerance of a well-assembled Original Prusa printer is 0,1 mm on the Z-axis and 0,3 mm on X and Y. It can be as little as 0,05 mm on all axes, after making additional calibrations such as the Extrusion multiplier calibration and Extruder linearity correction.

However, please note that the material is also relevant: it can shrink while cooling down, and low-quality filaments with uneven diameters will cause uneven extrusion. The optimization of the model for 3D printing (overhangs, etc.) is also important. Our printers are tested even for the 0.25 mm nozzle, which is more precise compared to the standard/stock nozzle with a 0.4 mm diameter.

[This article](https://manual.slic3r.org/troubleshooting/dimension-errors)

studies the accuracy of FDM printing in more detail.

All necessary tools (pliers, screwdriver, hex keys, wrenches…) are included in the package. If you are wondering what else you could need, here is a list of some nice-to-have things:

* 3.5'' side-cutter/flush-cutter pliers
* White permanent marker
* Compressed air
* A big bottle of IPA 91% to clean the sheet
* Acetone (only with the smooth sheet)



### What is the life expectancy of the printer?

According to our testing, the average maintenance interval of our printers is around 800 print hours. When it needs to be serviced, most frequently, it’s the nozzle that needs to be changed, and then it can continue printing for many hundreds of hours more.

The ideal air temperature is from 20 - 30 °C (68 - 86 °F) and the ideal air humidity is 25 %.

### What is the power consumption of a PRUSA printer?

The average power consumption that we have measured, at 26 °C (room temperature), is 80 W when printing generic PLA and 120 W when printing generic ABS.

# [Unpacking an assembled i3 printer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/unpacking-an-assembled-i3-printer_1937)

Congratulations on your new **assembled Original Prusa** printer. For any first-time users, we have prepared this article and video for you who are just starting out with a Prusa 3D printer.

This is complementary material to the bundled 3D Printing Handbook!

**Before switching the printer on, always carefully read the paper version of the 3D printing handbook,**

found in the box with your printer. The latest version of the Handbook is also available on our website in the

[Drivers section](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/)

, in the right-hand column.

### Unpacking the printer

* **Remove the "shipping helpers" (large foam pads)** \- The extruder and bed are secured by specially cut foam pads to secure these components during shipping. Remove them in this order:
*       1. Remove the top piece.
2. Lift the printer out of the bottom piece (you can hold it by the frame).
3. Pull out the middle piece of foam, securing the extruder.
* **Remove the test print from the Flexible steel sheet.**
* **Get out the Handbook and Gummy bears and get ready!**



### Familiarize yourself with the accessories

### Calibrations

An assembled printer is already calibrated so that you could start printing right out of the box. However, to account for any bumps the printer might have seen in transit to you, the printer will take you through the Z calibration the first time you start it up. This moves the X-axis to the top, pressing against the top of each Z-axis, to make sure it is the same on both sides.

This should be all the calibration necessary to start printing. However, different types of filament can act in different ways. You therefore should be aware of a couple of things.

* **The First Layer Calibration** \- Having the initial layer of your print too low or too high can cause issues with adhesion to the build plate or artifact/imperfection in your print. The nozzle can even clog if set too close. See our article on [how exactly your first layer should look](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364).
* **Idler screw tension** \- The idler screw should generally be set so its head is about flush with the plastic part. However, some filaments, like flexible filaments, require this screw to be very loose. Moreover, if this screw is tightened all the way in, it can cause the motor pulling the filament to overexert itself. For more info see [Idler screw tension](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/idler-screw-tension_177367).



### Handbook

All of our printers come with an instructional Handbook. This is not merely a collection of tips and tricks but is the **instruction manual for your machine.** They cover everything in regards to your printer, from setup, calibration, slicing, printing, and troubleshooting. Even if you are not new to 3D printing we advise you to read this thoroughly. All handbooks are [available in a wide range of languages](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/#driver-mk3s).

# [HW setup (MK2.5/S & MK3/S/+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hw-setup-mk2-5-s-mk3-s-_1943)

Introduced in the firmware version 3.8.0 on the MK2.5, MK2.5S, MK3, MK3S, and MK3S+ there is a section in the Settings menu, called “HW setup”. It allows you to inform the printer/firmware of hardware changes and which actions to take in case of a conflict.

To access these settings, please go to the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> HW setup_

**For each model the HW Setup menu differs a little:**

### Options MK3/S/+

### Options MK2.5/S

* [Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955)
* [Nozzle diameter](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/different-nozzle-types_2193) [0.25/0.4/0.6/0.8]
* Checks
* Nozzle [Warn/Strict/None]
* Model [Warn/Strict/None]
* Firmware [Warn/Strict/None]
* SuperPINDA [Yes/No] (MK2.5/S only)



### Nozzle diameter setup

By default, all Original Prusa printers are shipped with the 0.4 mm nozzle. In case you change the nozzle, you can set the correct diameter. The printer will then compare the stored value of the nozzle diameter with parameters saved by our Prusa Slicer in the G-code. If there is a mismatch, the printer is able to inform you and thus prevent a print failure.

This setting does not affect extrusion rates (flow) during First Layer Calibration. The article

[Different nozzle types](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/different-nozzle-types_2193)

will tell you more about First layer calibration for different nozzles.

### Preliminary checks

Besides checking the nozzle diameter, the printer is now able to check other parameters to warn you about incompatible settings. Before a print starts, the printer will compare parameters stored in the memory with the G-code.

The controller parameters are as follows:

* **Nozzle** diameter (0.25, 0.4, 0.6 etc.)
* **Model** if the printer g-code is sliced for (MK3, MK3S+, MK2)
* **Firmware** version



For each you can set three levels of warnings for each controlled parameter:

* **[none]** _-_ checking is turned off, the user won't receive any notification
* **[warn]** \- a warning message will be displayed on the screen, then the user can continue with the print
* **[strict]** \- a warning message will be displayed on the screen, the user _can't_ continue until he fixes the issue, and print is aborted.

# [First layer does not stick (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-does-not-stick-sl1-sl1s_1944)

If there is no object to be seen on the metal platform as it raises from the resin tank, it usually means that the first layer didn’t adhere properly to the platform. Let’s find the reason why it happened.

**Stop the print**

immediately after noticing this issue to avoid any damage to the FEP film.

### What does it look like

All or some of the objects you wanted to print are not on the printing platform. After you stop the print, unscrew and remove the resin tank and pour the resin out, you will see a blot or a flat blob of solidified resin stuck to the FEP foil.

Refer to the SL1 printed handbook, chapter 15.1, or

[this guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/removing-and-object-stuck-to-the-bottom-of-the-tank_1800)

to see how to remove it safely without damaging the fragile film.

### How to fix it

There is a number of reasons why the first layer does not stick to the printing platform. Generally, they can be classified either as assembly/hardware related or as calibration/settings related reasons.

#### **Calibration and settings**

#### The printer is not calibrated correctly

Even if nothing changed since the last calibration of the printer - you didn’t replace any parts, and you didn’t move the printer to a new location, a re-calibration may be required. Please refer to the [Calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-preflight-check_13824) chapter for step-by-step instructions. **Make sure not to skip any step!**

#### Incorrect slicing settings

To rule out slicing-related issues, try printing a sample (pre-sliced) object from the USB flash drive.

Re-slice your model using default settings and try printing the object again. Always use PrusaSlicer, where we have already prepared profiles for the most used resins. We have tested over a hundred of various resins, and we’re continually testing new ones.

Make sure that you are using the recommended exposure times for the resin of your choice. The exposure times for initial layers should be much longer (e.g., 45 seconds) that the regular layers to ensure a strong connection to the printing platform.

#### Object orientation / insufficient supports

Incorrect object orientation can be another source of adhesion problems. After a layer is solidified, the printer has to detach it from the bottom of the tank - if there is just single support holding a large part of the object, it may not withstand the peel force, causing it to detach.

Always position the model so that the largest flat part is in touch with the platform. When using supports, make sure there are enough of them. You can also use the pad to give the supports an extra surface. Keep in mind you can always adjust the Support points density and that you can manually add support points to the problematic areas of the design.

#### Resin has been mixed with IPA

The resin has been mixed with IPA (e.g., while cleaning the printing platform) and its properties have changed, so it cannot solidify. **Clean and dry** the resin tank properly, use a new batch of resin and try again.

### **Hardware and assembly**

#### The printing platform is not secured properly

After inserting the platform back to the printer, make sure that you didn’t forget to **tighten the black printed knob** at the top of the tower. A freely moving printing platform cannot reach an optimal position and the first layer won’t stick.

#### The bottom of the tank is dirty

Every time before pouring the resin into the tank, make sure that the bottom of the tank (the FEP film) is completely clear. A cloudy, dirty or damaged FEP film will have a negative impact on the printing quality. It may even **block UV light** and stop the resin from solidifying properly.

Clean the FEP film using **warm water** and a bit of **dishwashing** soap, and wipe it with **soft** paper towels. Low quality / rough paper towels could scratch the surface. **Do not use IPA nor acetone!**

#### Loose Torx screw(s)

The FEP film is tightened to the resin tank frame by twenty-two M4x8rt Torx screws. At the end of the assembly, all of these screws must be tightened into the frame. None of them should be protruding. The screws facing down, the frame must **sit on a flat surface without any rocking**.

#### A faulty print display or UV LED panel

If the first layer didn’t adhere to the printing platform and it’s **not attached to the bottom** of the tank either, it usually means that the first layer wasn’t created at all. A possible cause is a faulty print display or a faulty or disconnected UV LED panel. Unscrew the bottom cover off the SL1 and check whether the cable is connected on both sides.

# [Extrusion stopped mid-print (Heat creep)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extrusion-stopped-mid-print-heat-creep_1948)

If your printer suddenly stops extruding filament, yet continues the print moves without reporting any error, you may be a victim of a **heat creep**.

### What does it look like

Broadly speaking, we refer to heat creep when parts of the hotend above the **heater block** get too hot. Under normal circumstances, the filament starts melting just above the nozzle. However, when the heatbreak gets too hot, **the heat expands upwards** irregularly throughout your hotend, the filament starts to soften higher inside the hotend and causes a **clog**. The extruder motor grinds into the filament, it can even make a “clicking” or "ticking" sound as it tries to push the filament down the extruder.

Note that

**heat creep**

is only one

**of the ways by which your hotend can clog**

and most often than not, it is

**not the most probable explanation**

. We suggest that you read through our articles dedicated to hotend clogs, especially

[Under-extrusion](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/under-extrusion_2007)

,

[Clogged hotend](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3-5-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008)

, and

[Cold pull](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mk3s-mk2-5s_2075)

.

### How to fix it

#### Most common causes:

* The ambient (room) temperature is above 35°C (30°C for some filaments) or the printer is in an enclosure.



The heat creep usually happens when printing with PLA, as it has the **lowest melting temperature** among the most used filaments. Printing PLA in a fully closed and unventilated enclosure is very likely to cause problems.

* The filament you are using contains metal particles, which conduct the heat up the hotend.
* The hotend temperature is set too high.
* The thermal transfer between the nozzle, the heatbreak, and the heatsink is insufficient.
* There is not enough airflow cooling the heatsink.
* There is not enough filament flowing through the nozzle or it is not flowing fast enough.



The **filament itself absorbs heat**. If it is not extruded fast enough, it can contribute to heat creep.

### How to prevent it from happening

**After you have** [**cleaned the hotend**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3-5-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008) **,** check the collection of tips below to keep this problem from happening again.

**Good practice:**

After your print is finished, while the hotend is still hot,

**unload the current filament**

. Luckily, the MMU2S upgrade kit does this for you at the end of each print! If you don’t have the MMU2S, you can simply use the printer’s “Unload” feature.

### Extruder **assembly**

#### Gap between the nozzle and the heater block

In all assembled E3D v6.1 hotends, **there should be a gap** of about 0.5 mm (0.02 inch) between the heater block and the hexagonal head of the nozzle. Again, this is to control heat flow inside the hotend. When screwing your nozzle into the heater block, you should tighten it all the way in, but never try to (over)tighten it so that the nozzle head would touch the heater block.

#### Check the extruder fan

As you can imagine, the cooling fan needs to be working properly to cool the heatsink enough. First off, make sure that you **don’t see the sticker** on the fan - that would mean the fan is mounted backward. While spinning, it must push air **inside, not outside**.

If the fan is correctly mounted, you can check whether it is **spinning fast enough**. During the print, navigate to _LCD Menu - > Support -> Extruder info -> Fan speed_. The RPM value for the Nozzle Fan should be between 4000 and 4400.

#### Idler tension and Bondtech gear

**Too little or too much tension** on the extruder idler spring can also cause issues with filament extrusion. With the idler screw being too loose, the gears can't grip the filament and the motor can start skipping. With the **idler screw being too tight** , the teeth on the gears might **grind the filament and get choked** \- always make sure the gears are clean.

The

**head**

of the idler screw must be

**aligned**

with the Extruder Body, (see the photos above).In the case of the MK2/S, the tension springs are on the outside of the extruder. The length of the compressed tension springs should be 13 mm.

#### Make sure the heatsink is dust-free

The heatsink’s job is to **prevent the temperature from increasing** too much along the filament path. After many hours of printing, the fins on the heatsink can **accumulate fine dust** , which decreases heatsink’s effectiveness at dissipating the heat. One easy way to solve this is to remove the hotend cooling fan (the square fan on the left side of the extruder) and **blow the dust away with canned air.** While at it, blow the dust from the fan itself too.

#### Check that the PTFE tube is fully inserted in the hotend

It is very important to ensure the PTFE tube inside the hotend sits flush with the edge of the heatbreak. If you’ve recently taken the PTFE tube out from the heatsink, it is always wise to double-check that the PTFE tube is **secured in place** and **does not move up and down**. Fortunately, we have a guide for that [here](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ptfe-tubes-in-original-prusa-i3-printers_2065).

#### Add the thermal paste to the heatbreak

Especially if you were taking the hotend apart in order to clean it, before putting the hotend back together, don't forget to **apply some thermal paste** on the heatbreak thread that is in contact with the heatsink (the same kind of thermal paste used for computer processors). You can get the paste from our [eshop](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/thermal-paste-0-5g/), or similar high quality **generic thermal paste**. Here’s what your heatbreak should look like with enough thermal paste. Refer to [this guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-ptfe-tube-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_21664) (for MK3S/MK2.5S/MMU2S. For MK3/MK2.5, there is a [separate guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-ptfe-tube-mk3-mk2-5_17360)) for more information about how to dismantle the extruder and the hotend.

### Print settings

#### Lower the heatbed temperature

The heat rising from the heatbed may contribute to the overheating of the extruder parts. Especially (but not only) for a PLA print you can **lower the heatbed temperature** in Prusa Slicer **by 5 or 10 degrees**. In the PrusaSlicer, you can go to _Filament settings - > Filament_ and modify the temperature in the _Temperature °C_ field.

You can also do this during the print, in the _LCD Menu - > Tune -> Bed_ (and change the value by turning the knob), but in that case, do it only before the first layer finishes, otherwise, the sudden temperature change may deform the print.

If you would have problems with

**warping**

or

**adhesion**

after decreasing the bed temperature, use the

**Brim**

feature in PrusaSlicer.

#### Increase layer height

Printing with thin layers uses very little filament at a time, so there is not much filament flowing through the nozzle, which allows the heat to move up inside the extruder. One easy trick to test is to print with layer heights of 0.15mm or 0.20mm, for example. If you don’t need a particularly detailed print, go for thicker layers.

#### Increase print speed

A slow print can cause heat creep for the same reason when printing with thin layers. Increasing the print speed by 10% can help, however, we recommend not to exceed the speeds of 200 mm/s for infill print speed at layers of 0.20 mm and below.

Before starting to modify the speed settings in PrusaSlicer, test the speed modifications by

**turning the LCD knob first**

.

# [SL1/SL1S maintenance](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sl1-sl1s-maintenance_1951)

## Regular Printer Maintenance

Although the Original Prusa SL1/SL1S has a number of smart sensors and has been carefully designed to be easy to use, it’s still a machine and requires regular maintenance and care. There are several key areas that require attention if you want to keep your printer in good shape for a long time.

## Keeping the printer clean

The key to a trouble-free experience is first and foremost keeping the printer clean. Resins are liquids and they are easily spilled. Every time you use the printer, make sure you are not leaving drops or stains of liquid anywhere. A liquid resin will solidify even in regular daylight, making it much more difficult to remove compared to its liquid form.

When removing the printing platform / printed objects, use the black plastic tray to shield the printer from drops of resin. Always keep a bundle of soft paper towels near the printer, so you can wipe any spilled resin/resin drops immediately. To clean drops of resin more effectively, use a piece of cloth/paper towel dipped in isopropyl alcohol. **Do not use alcohol or acetone on the FEP film!** For more delicate surfaces (such as the display), use a mix of water and dishwashing product.

A good practice is to place a plastic tablecloth under the printer for easier cleaning. However, be careful - the tablecloth must not block the fan on the underside of the printer.

Do not wash the lid with any alcohol, acetone or chlorine! Also, do not use rough materials to clean the lid (e.g. sanding paper, rough sponges).

The lid is made of acrylic glass and it has a special surface finish to block UV light from reaching the printing chamber. You can clean it with standard products for cleaning glass, as long as it does not contain any alcohol, acetone or chlorine. It would damage the acrylic glass.

## FEP film / Tank maintenance

Empty the resin tank after each print. The tank has one corner which has a different shape than the other three. Use it in combination with a funnel to pour the resin out of the tank into a bottle. Don’t mix used resin with unused liquid. Instead, use a new bottle.

Inspect the resin tank bottom before and after each print. Look for any scratches, dents, or holes. If the FEP film is damaged, replace it immediately, otherwise, you’re risking a resin spillage.

If the FEP film has a grey-ish tint, you can restore it to its original look by washing it with warm water with a bit of dishwashing soap (or even regular soap) before you start printing again. Don’t print with a dirty or damaged FEP film, as it will negatively impact the print quality. It may even lead to damage to your printer. **NEVER use isopropyl alcohol to clean the FEP film!**

_Cleaning the FEP film - before and after._

## Printing platform maintenance

##

The platform should be cleaned thoroughly after every print - usually, there will be some leftover resin on the platform. Once a print finishes, place the black tray on the printer and use paper towels or a spatula to wipe the top of the platform clean, then proceed to remove the platform and the printed object.

Once the object is removed, use isopropyl alcohol and paper towels to clean the printing platform thoroughly. Leaving liquid resin on the platform for extended periods of time can lead to solidifying the material.

After removing an object, use a metal spatula to scrape any remnants of the previous print and use paper towels to wipe the underside of the printing platform clean - make sure that the printing platform is nice and shiny before you start the next print. Any leftovers on the printing platform (leftover supports, pads) could potentially damage the bottom of the resin tank or even the display. Surface scratches on the print platform won’t affect the quality of the print.

After you clean the printing platform with isopropyl alcohol, dry it thoroughly!

## Exposure screen maintenance

Use a damp cloth or LCD cleaning spray to keep the glass / LCD display clean. Don’t use any rough materials (sanding paper) or low-quality paper towels, otherwise, you might scratch the surface. Make sure that the print display is clean before you start a print and that there are no smudges, stains, scratches, or cracks.

Do not use sharp objects, such as metal spatulas, knives, flat screwdrivers, and similar tools to remove dirt or resin from the protective glass. Instead, use IPA or dishwashing products in combination with soft paper towels to avoid scratching the display.

## Acrylic lid

The lid has three major functions: it protects the printed model from potential damage, helps to contain resin fumes inside the box and blocks a significant amount of UV light so it doesn’t reach the printing chamber. Especially the last part is important - if you leave the resin in the tank and keep the lid open, it can start to solidify quickly depending on the environment.

The lid won’t stop 100% of UV light - do not place the 3D printer next to a window, otherwise, the sunlight might cure the resin in the tank.

This also means that you shouldn’t disable the cover check. It may be tempting to watch the print process, but for the sake of better results and safer operation, keep the lid closed during the print. You can, of course, open it for a quick check and then close it again.

Don’t run the printer with the lower case panels removed or with any parts missing. The case helps to contain the UV light.

Do not wash the lid with any alcohol, acetone or chlorine! Also, do not use rough materials to clean the lid (e.g. sanding paper, rough sponges).

## UV light and potential health risks

Eyes are very sensitive to UV light and UV radiation because the cornea absorbs high amounts of UV light. Extended exposure to strong UV light may lead to corneal damage, macular degeneration, or cataracts - these conditions can ultimately lead to blindness.

This is why the Original Prusa SL1/SL1S is designed to contain the UV light inside, which means that when used according to the instructions in the manual, there are no health risks related to UV radiation during regular use.

DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY INTO THE UV LIGHT AND DO NOT PRINT WITH THE BODY COVER REMOVED! If you want to check the UV led panel, look at it through your phone camera app or take a photo, so you won’t look directly into the UV light.

## Fan cleaning / Removing dust

It’s a good practice to clean the fans from time to time, especially if you have pets at home - the recommended time period will vary depending on the environment, in which the SL1/SL1S is used. In general, it’s good to inspect the printer every 6-8 weeks. There are three fans placed inside the printer. You can get to the side fan and bottom fan by removing the main body cover.

First, turn off the printer and disconnect it from the power source. Locate eight screws on the sides of the printer (four on each side) and remove them with an Allen key. Then carefully slide the body cover out. Be careful not to damage any cables which are attached to the power button. This will give you better access to two fans. Use a can of compressed air to clean the fans carefully.

The third fan is located on the backside of the printer. Locate two screws holding a small door closed and remove them. Open the door and use a can of compressed air to clean the fan.

Never blow compressed air on running fans!

Dust can also accumulate on the underside of the display and on the reflector. You can clean these parts carefully with compressed air. First, unscrew the eight screws holding the display in place, then slowly and carefully remove the display - be careful not to damage the display’s wires. Then, use compressed air from a distance of about 30 cm to clean out the dust particles gently. Do not use sharp or rough objects!

## Carbon filter replacement

Check the carbon filter from time to time to ensure it is in good shape. The carbon filter is located on the backside of the printer under a small door. Use an Allen key to remove two screws holding the door shut. Open the door and remove the filter. Check if it is in good shape, and consider replacing it if it isn’t.

## Tower maintenance

The tower (Z-axis consisting of the trapezoidal rod and the cantilever) requires little to no regular maintenance. In case the printer starts making unwanted noises when lifting or raising the platform, consider applying a lubricant on the trapezoidal rod - any good super lube will do the trick.

## Tilt maintenance

The key to a long-lasting and smoothly running tilt bed is simple: keep it as clean as possible. Use the included plastic tray every time you manipulate the resin or the printing platform with the finished print. The tray will stop the resin from spilling over the tilt bed.

# [Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955)

The Magnetic heatbed enables you to use flexible, **removable steel sheets**. There are different properties and strengths of each sheet, but they also have different thickness which affects calibration.

Therefore **we introduced Steel sheet profiles in firmware version 3.8.0 for MK2.5, MK2.5S, MK3, MK3S, MK3S+, and 4.3.0 for MINI and MINI+.** On all machines, you will find Steel sheet profiles under _Settings - > HW setup_. It allows you to create up to 8 specialized profiles for your printer setup.

By default, each sheet has the same factory settings. You must set the value for each sheet you wish to use. You can then easily switch between the sheets (profiles), and the printer will load the stored values. The printer will not remind you to change the steel sheet profile, as **it cannot sense which steel sheet you have.**

### How it works (MK2.5/S & MK3/S/+)

There are currently eight sheet profiles available with predefined, but customizable names.

To set up the individual sheet profiles, please head to the _LCDMenu_ -> _Settings - > HW setup -> Steel Sheets_:

For each sheet, the following settings are available:

* **Select** \- confirms the selection of the sheet, which will then become the default
* **First layer calibration** \- starts the [First Layer Calibration (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364) process for the given profile
* **Rename** \- enables you to change the name, up to seven characters
* **Reset** \- sets the values back to the factory defaults



#### Quick-toggle

As soon as two or more profiles are configured (by the First Layer Calibration), you will be able to quick-toggle between them directly from the main menu.

**Don't forget which profile you have attributed to which plate!**

Always carefully watch your first layer and in case the nozzle is too high or too low, stop the print and fix it either by setting the correct profile or by modifying the

[Live adjust Z](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/live-adjust-z_112427)

.

#### Renaming of the sheet

After selecting the **Rename** option in the sheet profile menu, you can change up to 7 characters of the profile name. The word "Sheet" cannot be changed; it is the " **Smooth1** ", " **Textur1** " etc. that you can customize. There is no way to delete or erase a wrongly selected character, but you can always restart the renaming procedure.

You start from the left and move to the right. By turning the knob, you are changing the characters, and by clicking it, you confirm the current character and move to the next one. When a character position is redefined, a small chevron mark will appear underneath it.

### How it works (MINI/+)

Starting from the firmware version 4.3.0, there are currently eight sheet profiles available.

To set up the individual sheet profiles, please head to the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> HW setup -> Steel Sheets_ (left picture).

For each sheet, the following settings are available (right picture):

* **Select** \- confirms the selection of the sheet, which will then become the default
* **First layer calibration** \- starts the [First Layer Calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-mini-mini_229122) process for the given profile
* **Reset** \- sets the values back to the factory defaults



#### Quick-toggle

As soon as two or more profiles are configured (by the First Layer Calibration), you will be able to quick-toggle between them directly from the _Settings_ menu.

# [SL1/SL1S print removing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sl1-sl1s-print-removing_1959)

In this guide, we will show you what to do when your SL1 print is successfully finished and you want to remove it from the metal platform.

When handling resins,

**always wear protective gloves**

and always

**clean up any drops**

of resin around the printer. In case the resin gets into contact with your skin,

**wash it off immediately with water and soap**

. If you experience discomfort (such as itching) or if the resin got in your eyes, seek out medical assistance immediately.

1. After the printing process finishes, open the lid and place the black plastic tray on the printer as depicted below.


2. Use a plastic spatula or paper towels to wipe the top part of the printing platform clean.
3. Unscrew the black printed knob at the top to unlock the printing platform.
4. Carefully slide the printing platform out (pull it towards you), and turn it sideways, so the remaining resin goes back to the tank or to the tray.
5. Use the bundled metal spatula to remove the print from the printing platform. Be careful not to scratch the platform.



**Do NOT use your fingernails**

to remove the prints since the plastic can easily get under your nails and break off. Besides, you should still be

**wearing gloves**

.

You should clean the printing platform thoroughly after every print - drops of liquid resin can solidify when exposed to sunlight, which would make them difficult to remove. Clean the channel at the top of the printing platform thoroughly. Use isopropyl alcohol to clean the platform.

Inspect the printed sample object. Check for any inaccuracies, missing parts, visible layers/lines, dents, blobs, or other defects.

# [FEP film replacement (SL1)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fep-film-replacement-sl1_1963)

Please note: Every time you replace the FEP film, tighten the screws properly, but don’t use excessive force. Overtightening the screws may lead to issues with their removal, during the next FEP film replacement.

**An extreme case of FEP film damage**

The FEP film is a consumable item, which means it will degrade after a certain time. You can order [replaceable FEP films from our e-shop](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/fep-film-3-pcs-sl1/).

If you replace the FEP film you must re-calibrate the printer!

### How to replace the FEP film:

Before you start, clean the tank thoroughly and wipe it clean. Use T20 Torx key to loosen the screws. Remove all screws and gently press your fingers against the used FEP film to release it.

DON’T use a cordless screwdriver, as it has too much torque.

After you remove the FEP film, take a spatula and scrape all bits of leftover resin from the edges. The edges must be perfectly clean, otherwise, the tank will leak

Clean the tank and frame using isopropyl alcohol

Remember to remove the protective plastic, **on both sides of the new FEP film.** Align the frame with the new FEP film, so the holes match, then start adding screws one by one.

Place the assembly onto the tank body and align the screws with the holes. Don’t create holes for resin tank screws yet!

Start tightening the screws only halfway one by one clockwise, as shown in the picture. After all the screws are inserted but not tightened, reseat the parts if necessary and tighten the screws in the same order. Make sure that all screws are tightly screwed.

Once everything is in place, take an object with a sharp tip (e.g. a 6mm drill bit) and puncture two holes for resin tank screws.

Re-calibrate the printer, using the tank with the new FEP film.

# [Resins](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/resins_1977)

Liquid resins are photosensitive materials used for printing on DLP, SLA and MSLA 3D printers. Resins are also known as photopolymers and they are **cured (solidified) by UV light** \- this also includes sunlight. Compared to filaments for FFF/FDM printers, the major difference is that there are not various materials such as PLA, PETG or ASA. There’s just THE resin; a base material that can be further enhanced with added colors or additives. The typical effects of additives would be increased hardness or toughness of the printed object.

The Original Prusa SL1 is a MSLA 3D printer that is compatible with 405nm resins.

Resins usually consist of three basic components:

* The core of the resin (monomers and oligomers)
* Photoinitiators - molecules reacting to UV light, which initiate the solidifying process
* Additives - admixtures that change the color and properties of the resin



## Important information about resins

There’s a couple of things to keep in mind when working with resins:

* Wear gloves to avoid direct contact of the resin with your skin
* A simple respirator is recommended
* Keep out of the reach of children and pets
* Shake the bottle well before every use for around 10 seconds (make sure the lid is securely tightened before doing so)
* Wash with water and soap in case the resin gets in contact with skin/eyes
* If you experience itching or any kind of discomfort after skin contact, seek out medical assistance
* Keep away from light, store in opaque bottles
* Keep at room temperature (18°-32°C), lower temperature changes the viscosity of the resin
* Do not store in dusty areas
* Resin produces fumes - keep the room ventilated during printing
* Some people may be allergic to resins - in case you experience any kind of discomfort (itching, rash), stop using the machine and contact a doctor



Do not throw resin bottles (empty or full) into regular waste!

Liquid resins should be **treated as dangerous chemicals** and you should follow your country’s laws regarding disposing of dangerous chemicals. There are usually special containers (e.g. oily waste cans) available for the public located near gas stations etc.

## Which resins to buy?

Once you start looking for resins to purchase, always check the wavelength of the resin - it determines at which wavelength the solidifying process starts. The Original Prusa SL1 printer is calibrated for 405nm resins and has no brand restrictions. Since it’s an open-source machine, you can choose any brand of resin you like, as long as it is compatible with the 405nm wavelength. However, always use recommended exposure times for the resin of your choice - extremely incompatible times may even lead to your printer getting damaged (e.g. setting 30 second curing time for a resin that solidifies in 6 seconds).

Some casting/dental resins should not be shaken, due to air bubbles.

Resins should be stored in their original containers and properly sealed, ideally in a dark room with a stable temperature. If the original container is damaged, use a non-transparent plastic bottle and the bundled funnel that came with the printer to pour the resin in it. Never store resin in bottles from drinks - if you have to, label it clearly. Do not store resins in cold places as it may lead to gelation of the resin.

## Types of resins

* Smooth surface, lots of details
* Fragile
* Not suitable for mechanical parts



* Semi-transparent
* Can be turned nearly fully transparent through post-processing



* Lots of details
* Great for preparation of casting forms
* Little to no remnants after burning the resin



Hard and resistant resins

* Similar to ABS or PP materials
* Partially flexible
* Suitable for mechanical parts
* Low resistance to high temperatures



* Highly temperature-resistant
* Used for injection forms
* Expensive



* Non-toxic
* Suitable for dental implants manufacturing
* Abrasion-resistant
* Expensive



* Similar to rubber (70A hardness)
* Lower resolution of printed parts

# [MMU2S regular maintenance](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-regular-maintenance_1980)

For future reference, see the picture below and try to remember the name of each part of the MMU unit. You will find this information in your printed MMU handbook as well.

#### **Hobbed pulleys - centered, tight, clean**

The pulleys may be grinding the filament and its dust may accumulate around them. The best practice is to clean the pulleys with a mini-brush or some similar tool every now and then. The pulleys also must be perfectly aligned with the filament holes, as shown on the photo below, and well tightened by the small black grub screw against the flat part of the Pulley motor axis.

#### **Clogged selector**

Even a properly calibrated selector can be occasionally blocked with filament strings or dust or by a broken piece of filament. By pushing the right MMU button, move the selector fully to the right, to the **service position**. Use an interdental brush or any thin wire (⌀ 1.5mm/0.06”) to push the waste through (still in service position). Use **compressed air** to clean any leftovers.

# [Internet connection (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/internet-connection-sl1-sl1s_1981)

Before you start the calibration process, it is advised to connect the printer to the internet, so that it can download updated firmware files (if they are available). There are two ways how to connect the printer to the internet and once you are connected you will either get an ethernet or Wi-Fi symbol in the top-right corner, next to the clock.

###

_Printer not yet connected to a network ( purple arrow)._

### Ethernet cable

You can use a standard RJ-45 ethernet cable. Connect it to your router, and the printer should obtain an IP address automatically - however, this may depend on your network configuration. Since every network is different, please refer to your router’s instructions or your internet provider’s tech support in case you run into trouble.

### Wireless connection

The SL1 3D printer has a built-in Wi-fi network card compatible with 2.4GHz networks. To open the Wi-Fi network browser, go to _Main Menu - > Settings -> Network -> Wi-Fi_. A list of all available networks will be displayed. Select your Wi-Fi network and connect to it by typing your password using the on-screen touch keyboard.

### Finding the printers IP address

Once your printer is connected to the network, you will find its IP address in Main Menu-> Settings -> Network, under Wifi or Ethernet, depending on how you are connected.

You can also use a wifi-scanner app, like Fing to find the printer on your network and its assigned IP. **The name of the device will be the Hostname of the printer** , default "prusa64-sl1".

### Troubleshooting

Since every network is different, we cannot provide exact instructions on how to connect to your wireless/wired network. If you encounter any trouble, please refer to your router’s manual, or contact your internet provider’s tech support. Moreover, the quality of your wireless connection depends on many factors - such as the type/configuration of the router, the distance of the printer from the router, or wireless interference in your area.

# [Problems with infill](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/problems-with-infill_1994)

Various problems with infill are not the worst kind of trouble you may come across, however, in some cases it can put the structural integrity of your prints at risk. The ideal time when you should check whether the infill is okay or not is when the object is still being printed.

Choose infill-type based on the application of the part. For mechanical parts, we recommend 3d-infills like Cubic or Gyroid. Otherwise, Grid will serve most purposes, but may not be perfect for all geometries.

### Troubleshooting

1. **Change infill type –** Certain infill types are more difficult to print, such as the cubic infill. Try using a different one, if possible.
2. **Flexible filaments –** Do not try to print complex infill patterns with flexible filaments. This type of filament is especially vulnerable to imperfect infills. The best bet is to use the GRID infill when printing flexible filaments. You can change the infill pattern in the **PrusaSlicer – Print settings – Infill – Fill pattern.**
3. **Lower the printing speed –** If none of the above helps, try to slow down the printing speed of the infill. This can be done in **PrusaSlicer in the Print settings – Speed – Infill**.

# [MMU2S idler unable to move freely](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-idler-unable-to-move-freely_1996)

If your MMU makes a loud clicking noise as the selector changes position, and if you see that the idler barrel was unable to rotate into the correct position, it is likely that your MMU idler is over-tightened. Loosen the two screws (one on each side of the MMU unit) a little bit and try again.

To find the perfect tension, tighten the screw about 0.1 mm to 0.4 mm under the edge of the hole on both sides of the idler body. All 5 filaments have to be loaded to the hobbed pulleys position. Then move with the selector to the far right (5th filament position) and back and observe. If you hear clicking, loosen the screws a bit and try to move with the selector again until there is no more clicking.

If you have a permanent marker, you can make a thin line inside of the oval hole to mark the correct screw position.

If the idler still can’t rotate freely, you can open the idler completely and verify that nothing's blocking it.

Check if the idler is centered and if the edges of the idler don’t grind the idler body. See if the idler is correctly tightened by the two M3 screws against the flat part of the motor shaft.

# [MMU2S Selector not moving](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-selector-not-moving_1997)

If the selector of your MMU2S upgrade is not moving smoothly, or if it cannot reach a certain position, the cause is usually one of the following issues:

### **The selector blade is loose**

The blade that is supposed to cut the filament strings was not attached properly or tightened enough during the assembly. It may have moved out of its socket and now it is blocking the movement of the selector.

1. Release the three screws holding the selector motor in place (left picture) and pull the motor out by turning the threaded rod of the black trapezoid nut. _You can also release the two M3x10 screws securing the trapezoid nut._
2. Pull both of the small smooth rods out using the Allen key (right picture). Then remove the selector (green circle).


3. Remove the holder's screws (blue arrows) and position the blade back in place and tighten its holder properly.
4. Reassemble the unit back to its original state.



### Updated selector blade holder

The blade equipped with the selector, which will cut the tip of the filament unloaded from the extruder, if needed. Until firmware version 3.9.0 of the MK3S/MK2.5S the cutting function was not enabled.

To start using this function, make sure you have:

* Firmware 1.0.6 or above installed in the MMU2S unit.
* Firmware 3.9.0 or above installed in the MK3S/MK2.5S.



The printed parts for the selector (mmu2-blade-holder and mmu2-selector-finda) were updated to provide a better grip of the blade and are [available for download here](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/Updated-MMU2S-blade-holder-and-selector.zip). _Print using PETG and PrusaSlicers 0.2 mm QUALITY preset._

### **The filament is bent and stuck in the selector**

1. Release the three screws holding the selector motor in place and pull the motor out by turning the threaded rod of the black trapezoid nut. _You can also release the two M3x10 screws securing the trapezoid nut._


2. Pull both smooth rods out (use the Allen key) and remove the selector.
3. Remove the broken filament string from the selector and reassemble the unit.



### **The selector motor isn’t working**

1. First, try powering the printer off and moving the selector by hand, by turning the threaded rod.
2. If that didn’t help or if you were unable to move the selector, release the three screws holding the selector motor in place (picture above) and pull the motor out.
3. Push the smooth rods out with an Allen key. You can now easily remove the selector.
4. Clean any stuck filament and try pressing the left and right control buttons. See if the motor’s shaft rotates. If not, the motor may be defective, or it is plugged incorrectly. Remove the MMU board with its cover and **cross-check with the picture on the right** to see if that is the case. Try also to unplug the cables and plug them back in to be sure.

# [Spaghetti monster](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/spaghetti-monster_1999)

### Why the name spaghetti monster?

This print issue looks exactly like it sounds, a big mess of "spaghetti" on and around your print **.** It is actually extruded filament, which was misplaced by the print head (extruder) because at a certain point during the print the object below moved or collapsed.

If the first layer isn’t perfect, the chance of any type of print failure increases.

### The most common reasons

1. The printed object detaches from the print bed during the print
2. The printed object collapses during the print
3. An error within the 3D model and/or the sliced file



### **Troubleshooting**

* **Check the first layer** – Simply make sure that the first layer is sticking properly to the whole print surface. You can refer to [First layer issues](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804).
* **Check the object for errors** – Always check the generated G-code in the **Preview** of our **PrusaSlicer**. PrusaSlicer will also display a small warning triangle next to the model should it find any obvious issues. In case you find any gaps or broken geometry, you can either repair the STL object yourself and check our article [Corrupted 3D models for printing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/corrupted-3d-models-for-printing_2205).
* **Try to increase the bed temperature** – If you have already experienced this error, try to re-run the print and increase the bed temperature by 5-10 **°** C. This should help with the first layer adhesion. You don’t have to re-slice the object and prepare a new G-code. Just start the print, go to the _LCD Menu – Tune – Bed,_ once the mesh bed leveling is completed **.**

# [Extruder blob](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extruder-blob_2005)

The blob (mass of plastic accumulated around the hotend) is one of the most scary-looking printing problems you might face together with your 3D printer. It is quite tricky, though not impossible, to remove it after it happens. To better explain the process, we have prepared a short video for you:

### How to clear the extruder blob

Before doing anything, please note that the cables of the hotend thermistor and the heater cartridge are most likely entangled in the blob. The heater cartridge cable in particular is very vulnerable as

**its insulation ends before the wire enters the cartridge body.**

1. Preheat the nozzle in the **LCD Menu - > Settings -> Temperature -> Nozzle **(or just preheat the printer as you do before you load a filament). The temperature needs to be approximately 30°C higher than the temperature at which the blob has formed. For example, if the blob is made of:
* **PLA:** preheat to 250 **°** C
* **ABS/PETG:** preheat to 280 **°** C



If you get a

[Thermal anomaly error](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/thermal-model-calibration_382488)

while heating the hotend, heat up the nozzle through

_LCD Menu - Settings - HW Setup - Nozzle Change_

.

1. If [MINTEMP](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mintemp-error-and-mintemp-bed_2169) or [Preheat error](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/preheat-error_2163) message appears on the LCD, it means the thermistor or the heater cable (respectively) is already broken. In this case, your only option is to use a heat gun to heat the plastic. Work very carefully, you don't want to melt the printed parts surrounding the hotend. Clear the blob little by little.
2. After the hotend reaches the right temperature, leave it this way for at least 5 minutes. **_Turn the printer off before the next step, or you might cause an electrical short.
_**
3. Smaller blobs will start to fall off by themselves. As for the bigger ones, use a pair of pliers to **carefully remove the now soft plastic** mass from the hotend. Again, be very cautious around the leads coming from the hot end, in particular, the thermistor leads. _ **
**_
4. Once the big chunks of the amassed plastic are removed, use a small brass brush to get rid of what's left (as shown in the video above).
5. In case you do not succeed, as well as in case the blob has damaged some of the extruder parts, you can find your spare parts [here](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/18-spare-parts). To see the spare parts section, you have to be logged into the account you used to purchase the printer.



Please note that damage caused by the blob is

**not covered by the warranty**

as it is neither hardware nor software related and can be prevented by properly calibrating the printer as well as by stopping the print as soon as the filament starts to stick to the nozzle.

See the bundled 3D Printing Handbook, chapter

**3.3 Safety instructions**

,

**point 10.: _Do not leave the printer unattended while it's still on!_**

#### **How to prevent this problem from happening**

Unlike the [Spaghetti monster](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/spaghetti-monster_1999) issue, the blob issue often occurs early during the print. In general, the blob forms if the first layer detaches from the print surface and sticks to the moving hot nozzle while it keeps extruding, causing the blob to grow.

In order to prevent this situation from happening, bear in mind these simple rules:

* Always make sure to **clean the print surface** before starting the print. See [_this guide_](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804) for more details.
* Take the time to [_adjust the first layer height_](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364) at the beginning of the print. Make sure that the first layer is sticking properly to the entire print surface.
* **Check the print every now and then.** If you observe any potential problem, pause the print and give yourself the time to solve it. As a last resort, you can always stop the print, adjust the settings, and start again.

# [Under-extrusion](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/under-extrusion_2007)

You can recognize under extrusion when there is material missing in your print’s layers. Printed objects with under extruded layers can be fragile and tend to break apart. There could be several causes to under-extrusion and you should also think if you recently did any changes to your printer (or perhaps no maintenance for a long period), as you might find the culprit there.

_Example of severe under extrusion (left cube) and a normal print (right cube)._

**Common factors in under extru** **sions are:**

### First layer calibration too close

Make sure you have performed the First Layer Calibration correctly. Avoid compensating for a lack of adhesion by squishing the first layer too much. If the nozzle is too close to the build plate, the filament can be obstructed from pushing through. We recommend running the first layer calibration every time you move the printer to a different location or do maintenance on the hotend, like changing the nozzle. Moreover, when you swap the steel sheet from the textured one to the smooth one you must recalibrate due to the sheet's different thickness. That is why we introduced the [Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955).

### Slicer settings

Each profile in the PrusaSlicer contains settings that determine temperature, speeds, and how much filament the 3D printer should extrude. The printer does not provide any feedback on how much filament actually leaves the nozzle. It can be that less filament is extruded than the firmware expects. If that happens, you may notice gaps in and/or in between printed layers.

Make sure you have set up your printer in PrusaSlicer by running the [Configuration Wizard](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/configuration-wizard_1754) and as a starting point you should use the stock filament profiles which are tailored for your machine, filament type, and nozzle size.

### Nozzle

If you had the nozzle removed from the hotend at some point, make sure it has been correctly reinstalled. Please see the dedicated guide for your hotend:

Incorrect installation can cause both clogging and leaks. The nozzle must be tightened when heated and there must be a gap between the nozzle and the heater block. Also, inspect the extruder and hotend for any damage, like the heater element or thermistor's wires or a bent heatbreak (only on V6 hotend).

#### Using specialty nozzles

If you are using specialty nozzles like hardened steel or stainless steel, etc., you may have to increase the nozzle temperature when printing, usually within a range of 5-10 °C. Steel has different thermal properties compared to a brass nozzle, which can affect print results, mainly the inter-layer adhesion. But remember that higher temperatures can also lead to increased stringing. If the issue persists, try replacing the nozzle with the original 0.4mm brass nozzle and see if it makes a difference.

Furthermore, not all nozzle sizes will be suitable for all filaments. Filament that contains particles of wood or metal will most often be unsuitable for nozzles with a diameter below 0.4, and some will require an even larger nozzle, like 0.6 mm or 0.8 mm. For more information, please see [Different nozzle types](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/different-nozzle-types_2193).

**A 0.1 mm nozzle can be considered experimental** ; Its small diameter will not work with all filaments, the tolerances required in its manufacturing are hard to guarantee and the excessive printing time it requires can be beyond reasonable. For these fine resolutions, you may want to consider SLA printing.

### Extruder gears

Check both Bondtech gears for any dirt or misalignment so they are able to push filament through. Please see [Checking/re-aligning the Bondtech gear (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/checking-re-aligning-the-bondtech-gear-mk3s-mk2-5s_133176) for details.

Additionally, make sure that your printer’s [extruder idler is at the correct tension](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/idler-screw-tension_177367). Having the idler screw too loose or too tight can cause under extrusion.

### Insufficient hotend cooling

Controlling the "melt-zone" of the filament is very important. With insufficient cooling, the filament can start melting too far away from the nozzle. Check that your extruder fan is installed in the correct orientation and whether the fan is blocked by a piece of filament or some other debris.

Unless you have turned off "Fan check", the printer will give an error if it detects if either fan is not spinning when it should (

[hotend fan](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hotend-fan-is-not-spinning_2084)

or

[print fan](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/print-fan-is-not-spinning_2081)

).

If you are using your printer in an enclosure, make sure the temperature inside is not too hot, as overheating can result in Heat creep, where the filament will start melting before it reaches the nozzle

_Example of a blocked fan by a strand of filament._

The hotend fan will always spin if the nozzle is heated above 50 °C.

### Filament

Too low or too high printing temperature can cause print issues as well. If your filament brand and type is not listed in PrusaSlicer, you can try to adjust the print temperature by +/- 5-15°C to see if this resolves the issue.

Some specialty materials, like [Flexible materials](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flexible-materials_2057), may require many adjustments and tweaks to print them successfully. [Composite materials](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/composite-materials-filled-with-carbon-kevlar-or-glass_167387), like Woodfill filament, may require at minimum a 0.6 mm nozzle, and 0.2 mm layer height to prevent clogging. If there are composite materials like kevlar or carbon fiber, a [hardened nozzle is required](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/different-nozzle-types_2193#hardened-steel-nozzle-by-e3d).

Some filaments can also have a varying thickness, due to quality or infused materials like wood, which will cause unexpected changes in the volume of extruded filament. The industry standard of variations in diameter is +/- 0.05 mm.

Keep your filament dry, free of moisture because damp filaments have a negative impact on printing, especially soluble filament, PETG, and ABS. We highly recommend putting spools back inside their original bag when it’s not in use, along with a silica gel. We recommend storing your filaments in a dry area or ideally in a “dry box”.

#### Incorrect loading/unloading

When loading a new filament with a lower specified temperature, preheat the nozzle to the temperature required by the previous filament type you have used. In other words, always the highest temperature filament, as its remnants are most likely still in the hotend. For example, **if you have printed with ABS or PETG and want to print with PLA now, load the PLA filament at the ABS or PETG temperature.** This way, the newly introduced filament can push the old one out.

# [Clogged nozzle/hotend (MK3.5, MK3S+, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3-5-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008)

A 3D printer's hotend can get clogged. This article explains the most common causes of this issue, which are usually the same regardless of the printer type or model. We then have a separate article with tips on how to prevent the clog from forming in the first place.

### What does it look like

The most obvious symptom is that the filament is **not coming out of the nozzle**. However, please note that the hotend can also be clogged only partially. **Partial clogs** usually reveal themselves **mid-print** , even after you were able to load or unload the filament.

Early signs of the nozzle starting to clog are:

* The filament is not extruded out of the nozzle consistently
* Printed lines look much thinner and sometimes not sticking to the build plate.
* The extruded filament is curling up and sticks to the nozzle when purged.



Another common sign is that you can hear some **clicking** or ticking **sounds from the extruder**. The extruder clicking noise means that the stepper motor has to exert more force than a specific preset threshold and it's jumping back by one or more steps (skipping) to relieve the pressure.

It is important to know that having a **clogged hotend is not the same thing as having a clogged nozzle**. The clog might be located in the PTFE tube (inserted in the heatsink) or elsewhere, so **changing the nozzle is not a universal solution to this problem**.

### How to fix it

There are three main methods of dealing with this problem. To choose the right method, see whether or not it is possible to load/ unload the filament. Partial clogs can usually be melted or cold pulled, more complex clogs that prevent even loading of the filament call for the third method described below.

Before you begin with any of these methods, **unload the filament** and remove it from the extruder. To make the work easier, **move the extruder head up 10-15 cm** from the _LCD menu - > Settings -> Move axis -> Move Z-axis_.

#### Cold pull

A cold pull is a good place to start if you experience a clog. If the filament can be loaded and unloaded without any problem, yet it still causes trouble during the print, clean the inside of your hotend using the [Cold pull (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mk3s-mk2-5s_2075) technique.

#### Force the clog out

In case it is not possible to load the filament, try to soften the clog by increasing the nozzle temperature and then force it out. This is similar to the cold pull procedure.

**To avoid any complication, toggle the Filament autoload OFF in the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> F. autoload,_** before proceeding _._

1. Go to the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> Temperature -> Nozzle_. Set the nozzle temperature to 260 °C if you have been using PLA or to 280 °C if you have been using PETG or ABS.
2. After the nozzle reaches the required temperature, wait for 2 minutes - the filament should start pouring/dripping out.
3. Push the **bundled acupuncture needle** (0,3 mm to 0,35 mm diameter) into the nozzle **from below.** Insert it 1-2 cm deep, to help clear the clog. **Never feed it in from the top and do not load filament while the needle is inserted.**



Be careful not to touch the hot nozzle with your hand!

4. If that did not help, try using a 1.5 mm thick 100 mm long, straight, rigid metal wire: insert it into the hotend to see how far it can go and push on it, trying to force the filament down into the nozzle and then out. You can also use the smallest of the bundled Allen keys. It is not very long though, so remove the filament sensor cover to reach further.



Be very careful when manipulating this wire, we don't want to damage the hobbed gears or the PTFE tube.

5. Load some PLA filament. The new string should push the rest of the stuck material from the nozzle.



#### Clean the hotend parts

If you didn't succeed, it is important to determine where exactly is the clog located. As said earlier, a clogged hotend is not the same as a clogged nozzle: the material can be jammed even above it.

If you did not succeed to force the clog out, at least you can now estimate where does the clog starts based on how deep did the wire goes.

Open the Extruder Idler door and check if you won't see a piece of the filament sticking out of the PTFE tube.

* If you have an MK2/S, unscrew [both M3x40 screws](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/Pi51Q431dI24DKDR.jpg) with springs, the door should then open by itself.
* If you have an MK3 or an MK2.5, unscrew [both M3x40 screws](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/pJ12NOO1UYDu2vej.jpg) under the hexagonal window (they also have springs on them).
* If you have an MK3S or an MK2.5S, unscrew the single [M3x40 screw](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/3mQKqKUUYTLfaxL3.jpg) (also with a spring).



#### **Filament stuck in the PTFE tube**

If the filament is stuck in the white Teflon tube, you need to take the hotend out from the extruder. Use [this guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-ptfe-tube-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_21664) to do so (steps 2 - 5). You will be left with the hotend exposed, hanging in front of you. Preheat it via _LCD Menu - > Settings -> Temperatures -> Nozzle (260 °C if you have been using PLA or to 280 °C if you have been using PETG or ABS)_ and see if you can remove the filament by pulling it up from the PTFE tube using pliers.

Be careful not to touch the hot metal parts!

Sometimes, it is necessary to remove the PTFE tube, in which case you need to push the [black nylon collet](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/YQ3xHHYCK3H3JXXa.jpg) down towards the heatsink, in order to release it. While still pushing down on the collet, pull the PTFE tube out.

If the PTFE tube has been permanently damaged by the clog or in the process of removing it, **you can purchase a new one** in our online store ([MK3S, MK2.5S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/mk3mk3s/929-hotend-ptfe-tube-mk25s-mk3s-mmu2s.html) or MK2/S, MK3, MK2.5). When you insert the new PTFE tube, make sure again it is properly secured by the collet: you need to pull the collet up about 1 mm while, at the same time, pushing the PTFE tube down. Doing this will ensure there is no play as **the PTFE tube cannot move** inside the hotend. **Failure to secure the PTFE tube can cause clogging.**

#### **Filament stuck inside the nozzle**

If the PTFE tube is empty, some debris might be stuck in the nozzle. Unscrew it from the heater block (check [this guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/changing-or-replacing-the-nozzle-mk2-5s-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5_2069) to see how to do that). There are two ways to clean it: mechanically or using chemical solvents.

If your nozzle has seen a lot of use, and/or is old it might be better to just replace it.

* To clean the nozzle mechanically, once it is removed from the hotend, heat it up using a heat gun or possibly a hairdryer, and extract the stuck matter with needle-nose pliers or a pair of tweezers.
* If you were using PLA or ABS, it is possible to clean the nozzle chemically. ABS dissolves in acetone and PLA in tetrahydrofuran or ethyl acetate. Immerse your nozzle into one of these substances for a couple of hours to overnight and then use the needle-nose pliers or a pair of tweezers to remove the gooey mass.



### After resolving the clog

#### Clean the Bondtech gears

If you have had a clog, they can also have collected residue grinding the filament which will, in turn, reduce their grabbing force on the filament. Make sure you clean this out. Open the idler door and clean out each groove of the gear using a toothpick or the acupuncture needle that came with the printer.

Cover the PTFE tube to avoid any debris falling in. You can use a cotton swab - it will reliably cover the tube without damaging it). After you're done cleaning, give it a good puff of air to clear any remains, while the PTFE tube is still covered.

#### Calibration

If you have changed the nozzle you should redo, at least, the [First Layer Calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364), as this may have changed with the new nozzle.

If you have disassembled and reassembled the extruder and/or hotend, we recommend going through the full XYZ calibration, followed by the First Layer Calibration.

# [Warping](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/warping_2011)

When printing large objects, you can sometimes run into an issue with the corners of the object being lifted from the bed – mostly when printing with high-temperature materials such as PC Blend, ASA or ABS. It’s usually a result of a sudden temperature difference between the melting temperature of the nozzle and the ambient temperature. When this happens, the plastic will shrink and warp. Our goal is to minimize the thermal shock the printed part receives so it doesn't warp as much. Less warping also means less residual tension and a stronger part.

Adding a layer of glue stick, applied thinly on the steel sheet when cold, can both help adhesion and act as a separation layer, protecting the sheet from wear and tear.

Each material requires a different technique to prevent the lifting of the object. Different geometries may also need different approaches. Be sure to check our [extensive material table](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials) for more information.

### Troubleshooting

* Use PrusaSlicer profiles – Make sure you are starting off by using corresponding default profiles in PrusaSlicer. You may save yourself a lot of hassle with figuring out the ideal settings yourself. Profiles are already refined for each material.
* **Keep the surface free of grease** – Before starting any of your prints, simply wipe the print surface clean with IPA 90%+. A complete guide on how to prepare the print surface can be found at [First layer issues](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804).
* **Lower the Live Adjust Z** slightly to increase bed adhesion. But not too much. Do not over-squish the first layer. Be aware the bed adhesion might be too high with PETG or PC and might result in a damaged PEI surface.
* **Print cooling.** Some materials such as PLA or PETG need a lot of cooling. If corners of your print are lifting up, check if the print fan is enabled, try increasing the print fan speed. Check if the print fan actually works and the fan shroud isn´t obstructed or molten.
If steep overhangs and small parts of your print are warping, you may try enabling the print fan at low speeds (10-20%) even for materials that do not require a lot of print-cooling such as ABS or PC-Blend. This may help for example if you have a printer in an enclosure or if the problematic part is drowned in between supports that are retaining heat. Be aware that too much print-fan speed may warp and lift up the whole object and may decrease layer-to-layer adhesion. Our goal is to cool the part neither too fast nor too slow.
If you experience lower layer-to-layer adhesion or even print cracking after raising the print-fan speed, try increasing the nozzle temperature to restore the bonding of the individual layers together properly.
* **Ambient temperature** – For high-temperature filaments, try to maintain a stable ambient temperature. An open window or an AC unit nearby the printer will increase the occurrence of warps. High-temperature materials generally require higher ambient temperature not to warp during printing. If you print with these materials most of the time, you should consider having the printer in an enclosure. Printing PLA or PETG in an enclosure might not be a good idea. These materials need a lot of print cooling, which is harder to achieve with a higher ambient temperature. It is possible to either purchase an enclosure in our e-shop. You can purchase the [Original Prusa Enclosure](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-enclosure-3/) in our e-shop. It is also possible to [make your own enclosure](https://www.prusaprinters.org/cheap-simple-3d-printer-enclosure/).
* **Use a skirt and try to print more objects at once.** For high-temperature materials such as PC-Blend, ASA, or ABS, try using a printed skirt (draft shield) to retain heat in and around the printed object. Printing more objects at once may also help with retaining heat. Try to orient the problematic parts of the objects towards the center of the heatbed.
* **Decrease the print speed.** This may help a lot with high-warping materials. Although Prusament PC-Blend is low-warping compared to other PC-Blend filaments, decreasing the print speed will help your part as a whole to settle down, melt individual layers together properly and warp less. It also increases the layer-to-layer adhesion and part strength.
* **Use the brim** – A brim is a good way how to increase the adhesion to the print surface.



If the brim isn't enough, try adding a small geometry (like a tiny cylinder) specifically to the culprit area. The object should only be a few layers tall so it is also easy to remove.

# [Extruder noises](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extruder-noises_2013)

Filament grinding, which is accompanied by a “clicking” or "squeaking " sound coming from the extruder, usually happens when the extruder gears are unable to push the filament further towards the nozzle. Over time, the gears grind away the filament, until they can’t grab it anymore.

The clicking sound means that the stepper motor is having to suddenly exert more force than a specific preset threshold and it's jumping back by one or more steps (skipping) to relieve the pressure. It can be a mechanical issue, electrical issue, software issue, jammed/clogged hotend, or a combination of this.

## Possible causes

### Slicing

Slice the model again using the **latest version of PrusaSlicer and its filament presets**. Also, see if the 3D model is not corrupted or incomplete.

Try to increase the **hotend temperature** (Filament settings -> Filament -> Temperature °C) **by 5 - 15** °C. It is important to make sure the temperature is corrected for the filament being printed. You can check our [Extensive Material table](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials) to confirm your settings.

### First Layer calibration

Having the first layer calibration set too close can eventually cause a clogged hotend. Make sure you have it set just right, as instructed in [First Layer Calibration (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364) and [First Layer Calibration (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-mini-mini_229122).

### Idler tension

Make sure that your extruder idler is properly tightened. If the extruder idler screws are overtightened, the gears will not push the filament properly. Try to loosen (or tighten) the **extruder idler screw(s)** (with the spring). Their tension must be accurate (neither too tight nor too loose). Please see [Idler screw tension](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/idler-screw-tension_177367) for how it should be on your printer.

### Drive gears alignment

Double-check the **alignment** of both extruder gears. Both of them must be aligned with the opening above and with the PTFE tube below so that they can properly feed the filament into the hotend. Make sure the gear on the extruder motor shaft is tightened by its grub screw against the flat part of the motor axis.

Please see [Checking/re-aligning the Bondtech gear (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/checking-re-aligning-the-bondtech-gear-mk3s-mk2-5s_133176) for more information regarding the MK2.5/S and MK3/S/+ or [this article for the Original Prusa MINI/MINI+](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-access-and-clean-the-extruder-pulley-mini-mini_126457).

### Dirty extruder gears

* Make sure that your extruder gears are clear of any leftover plastic. You can clear the plastic with a sharp corner of pliers or with a durable pin.
* Make sure the gears are turning freely
* Check if the motor gear is aligned and tightened with the grub screw against the flat part of the motor axis



Please see [Checking/re-aligning the Bondtech gear (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/checking-re-aligning-the-bondtech-gear-mk3s-mk2-5s_133176) for more information regarding the MK2.5/S and MK3/S/+ or [this article for the Original Prusa MINI/MINI+](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-access-and-clean-the-extruder-pulley-mini-mini_126457).

### Jammed PTFE tube

While checking the extruder gears, take a look at the PTFE tube as well and make sure there is no debris in it that would prevent the filament from being loaded properly. To inspect the PTFE tube, open the extruder idler door. For more information, please see [Removing filament from extruder manually](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/removing-filament-from-extruder-manually_121491).

### Hotend assembly

Verify, whether the **nozzle is properly assembled** into the heater block:

* See if the heater block and the nozzle are not crooked.
* Is there a space of 0.5 mm (0.02 inch) between the nozzle head and the heater block as it should be?



Check

[Under-extrusion](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/under-extrusion_2007)

where we go through all the usual causes of extrusion-related problems.

### Clogged hotend

Please follow [this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3-5-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008) to clean your hotend, as the hotend might be clogged. If you don't manage to clean the clog, you would have to **take out the hotend** from the extruder, disassemble it completely, clean it thoroughly and apply some **extra thermal paste** on the heatbreak before assembling the hotend back together.

If you need to change one of the components of your hotend, refer to

# [Filament Not Loading](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-not-loading_2014)

If the filament is not loaded into the extruder, yet the printer is trying to pull the filament inside. It is usually a simple hardware problem, which we will fix in this article.

### Ideal preparation checklist:

1. Cut the tip of the filament at a 45-degree angle

2. Filament goes straight around the pulley into the hotend PTFE tube - **If the filament is bent slightly it may go around, especially flexible filaments are sometimes tricky to align perfectly!**
3. Make sure that there is as little deformation as possible of the filament which is being loaded in.



**Make sure that you are using proper nozzle temperatures.**

### Mechanical problems:

* **Loose pulley:** ensure that the set screw of the extruder drive gear is secured against the flat side of the extruder motor shaft.
* **Gummed up teeth:** the extruder gear has teeth which bite into the filament, ensure that the teeth are clean and clear of any plastic. Clean the grooves in the gear if necessary.
* **Extruder gear misalignment** : the filament has to travel in a straight path, any sort of deviation will create friction and cause the extruder to either misdirect the filament or be unable to feed it properly. Visually check to see that the groove of the extruder gear passes directly in line with the top of the hotend PTFE tubing.
See the [Re-aligning the Bondtech gears article.](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/checking-re-aligning-the-bondtech-gear-mk3s-mk2-5s_133176)
* **Loose / Over-tightened Idler spring:** The spring in the extruder is pressing the filament against the gears by pulling the idler gear or bearing. Make sure that the spring is not too loose, not too tight. See the [Idler screw tension article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/idler-screw-tension_177367) for more info.



Would none of the above ease your problem. Please visit

[Clogged nozzle - MK2/MK3](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3-5-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008)

. There is a chance that you are dealing with a clogged nozzle, rather than Filament loading problems.

# [Misaligned PINDA Sensor (MK2/S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/misaligned-pinda-sensor-mk2-s_2016)

**A misaligned P.I.N.D.A. Sensor** is an issue that can be fixed by fine-tuning the printer. To do that, you need to calibrate the P.I.N.D.A. sensor position on multiple spots around the heated bed. Once we get the first three right, then you should not experience any calibration errors at all.

**Before you proceed with the checks and procedures outlined below** , go through your assembly and make sure bearings/rods are lubricated, belt tension is good and that pulleys are properly secured, aligned, and free of any filament debris.

### Side shift

Side shift is not very common due to the printer's design. However, the **e** **ndstop** can be misaligned during the assembly. To fix it, you must unscrew the Endstop and push it to its proper place. Then tighten the screws again and secure it with screws again, while holding it.

### Front shift

The front shift can happen if the frame is not perfectly perpendicular to the **Front** and the **Rear** of the printer. In order to fix it, simply unscrew the **M12 nuts** holding it and move the frame to its designed position (either to the front or back, depending on the relative position of the P.I.N.D.A. sensor).

Make sure the Y-axis is perfectly level - all four corners of the frame must touch the ground.

### Twist shift

This is probably the most common issue with the Y-axis. Just like with the **Front shift,** simply unscrew the M12 bolts holding it and move the frame to the correct position.

Usually, it will be a combination of two problems. Take your time with fine-tuning, as it is crucial to achieving a proper calibration of your printer.

---

# [Layer shifting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layer-shifting_2020)

**Layer shifting** is a printing issue, which causes the layers of the printed object to **shift from their intended positions.** It is usually associated with an abnormal movement of the X-axis and/or the Y-axis, leading the extruder head to be misaligned mid-printing.

In order to troubleshoot the issue correctly, it is crucial to recognize in which axis did the layers shift. See the three photos below demonstrating three different kinds of layer shifts. Troubleshooting itself is the same for both axes.

Layer-shifts are most often caused by the wrong tension of the belts or pulleys not being secure.

### Prusa i3-series

### Check your printer’s power mode

Run the printer in **Normal mode** rather than in the **Stealth mode**. You can change Power mode in the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> Mode_. The stealth mode is perfect for small and simple objects. For bigger or more complex prints, the Normal mode is recommended. Also, note that in Stealth mode, the Crash detection feature is not available.

### Make sure the extruder and the heatbed can move freely

Make sure there are **no obstructions** in the path of the extruder or heatbed and their bearings. For example, there might be a piece of filament stuck around the belt (usually around the Y-axis pulley) from your previous prints.

Another instance of obstruction is when the zip ties or another part of the extruder cable bundle are not arranged according to [5\. E-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_28536). If the cables hit the frame before the extruder assembly does (if it's an MK3) or before the X end-stop does (if it's an MK2/S or an MK2.5) the printer detects an inaccurate end position. See the photo below and make sure the cables are arranged accordingly.

Also, verify if the smooth rods don't bear any deep scratches and if the bearings are properly lubricated. According to our testers, the best lubricant is a homogeneous, soft grease with lithium additives, such as the GLEIT-µ HF 400. Another good lubricant is the Mogul LV 2-EP. In general, Super-lube or any other multi-purpose grease will do as well.

### **Check your X/Y axis motors and pulleys**

Make sure the X and Y **motor** is tightened in the motor mount, that the **pulley** (orange arrows in the picture below) is secured on the motor shaft and aligned with the pulley on the opposite end, and that the pulley can move freely. **Both grub screws** need to be tight, **one of them has to be tightened against the flat part of the motor shaft.** A loose pulley is usually the main cause of staircase layer shifts.

Both pulleys on both axes also have to be **aligned** , meaning the motor pulley has to be well **centered and the belt has to be moving in a straight line,** not traveling from right to left while the pulley is turning.

### **Check the tension of your belts**

Check your belt-tension. If you have an MK3 or MK3S, check the **Belt Status** numbers via _LCD menu - > Support -> Belt Status_. The values should not be under 240 and above 300, but there is no single ideal value. The number does not represent any quantity.

* If your value is **under** (or close to) 240, you need to **loosen** the belt
* If your value **over** (or close to) 300, you need to **tighten** the belt
* The values are updated every time you run the Selftest or run the belt test in _LCD menu - > Calibration -> Belt test_.



The MK2.5S, MK2.5, and lower models do not have the belt status option. The clue we can give you is that the belt should sound roughly like a low bass string when plucked. It should be possible to pinch the two sides together with your thumb and index finger, but you should feel a little bit of resistance.

The plastic parts holding the belts can get loose over time.

Use the technique described in [this step](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_28536#30816) of the assembly manual to test if the pulley is correctly tightened and if the belt is not too loose. Hold the X-axis motor shaft with pliers (take advantage of the flat part of the shaft) and try to move with the extruder. The same procedure can be applied to test the Y-axis pulley and belt.

### **Print geometry and settings**

Objects with **overhangs** are generally harder to print. Some overhangs might even warp upwards during the print, and the nozzle might crash into them. The same can happen in some cases if you choose **too small infill percentage** when slicing the 3D model. To prevent printing overhangs, you can cut the object (check out our article on the [Cut tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cut-tool_1779)). You can also try to increase the print fan speed or increase the Z-hop distance in PrusaSlicer. Print fan speed is found in _Filament settings - > Cooling_ and Z-hop distance in _Printer Settings - > Extruder 1._

### Prusa MINI

**Check your printer’s speed.**

When printing large objects, it’s recommended to decrease the printing speed. During a print, go to _LCD Menu - > Tune -> Speed_ and decrease the number.

Make sure that belts are properly tightened. Belts should be tight enough to sound like a low bass note when plucked. If the belts are loose, tighten them first: first, loosen the two screws as depicted below. Then, tighten the two screws at the very end of the X-axis. They go directly against the metal rods, so the more tightened they are, the further you move the plastic part. Once you are done, tighten the first two screws again to fix the part in place.

Both pulleys on both axes also have to be aligned, meaning the motor pulley has to be well centered and the belt should be perfectly straight. Check whether the X-axis belt is not brushing against printed parts.

Make sure **nothing is blocking the movement of your axis** – Check for any obstructions in the path of the bearings or any possible waste from previous printings stuck around the belt (usually around the Y-axis pulley).

#### Loose X/Y-axis belt pulley

**If the set-screw on the belt pulley has come loose or it was not secured on the flat side of the motor shaft, it can slip and may cause issues with the axis not moving perfectly in tandem with the motor's rotation.**

The set-screw for the Y-axis is easily accessed, being under the bed, but the X-axis is a bit more tricky. You can access the set-screw for the X-axis through a hole on the top of the extruder (picture below). You will not be able to see if the set screw is aligned with the flat side of the motor-rod and **tightening it will only be a temporary fix** , but it is a great way of knowing if this is the issue and what needs to be disassembled.

If you only see shiny metal in the hole, you must rotate the motor to reveal the set-screw. Even it is loose, it will move a little with the rotation of the motor, revealing the screw. Access _Settings - > Move Axis -> Move X_, on the LCD-menu, and **rotate the knob to spin the motor**.

Use a 2 mm Allen key to tighten the set-screw of the pulleys.

#### Free movement of the axis

Make sure the print head (the part moving along the X-axis) can move freely in the entire range. Especially the cable bundle attached to the extruder should not prevent the print head from reaching the end of the axis.

Also, **verify if the smooth rods are not scratched and if the bearings are properly lubricated**. According to our testers, the best lubricant is a homogeneous, soft grease with lithium additives, such as the GLEIT-µ HF 400. Another good lubricant is the Mogul LV 2-EP. In general, Super-lube or any other multi-purpose grease will do as well.

#### None of this solved the problem?

No worries, at least you have checked some of the most important parts of the printer, and you can now be sure they are OK. Please try to print one of the g-codes that were on the SD card when you first used it. If you have deleted them, try [this one if you have an MK3](https://media.prusaprinters.org/media/prints/62/gcodes/339199_4bcc07c4-01e9-4b38-9a6d-931af9213c3d/buddy_015mm_pla_mk3_2h14m.gcode), or [this one if you have an MK2.5 or an MK2/S](http://prusa3d.com/downloads/others/buddy-0-15-mm-pla.zip).

**On MK3(S):** You may also try to **toggle the Crash Detection off** (LCD Menu -> Settings -> Crash. det. [on/off] or, during the print _LCD menu - > Tune -> Crash Detection_). It also usually helps if you **slow down the print speed** (in the Slic3r or during the print by turning the knob counter-clockwise).

# [Calibration failed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/calibration-failed_2033)

The Calibration failed error occurs once there is a problem with the calibration. The printer was unable to properly detect the calibration point/s and can not successfully finish the calibration. In order to operate the printer, you must find the source of the problem and fix it.

For

**MK2.5/MK2.5S printers that have the SuperPINDA**

installed, you

**MUST use firmware version 3.9.3, or above!**

There can be **five different error messages** related to the Calibration failure:

* XYZ calibration failed. Bed calibration point was not found.
* XYZ calibration failed. Please consult the manual.
* XYZ calibration failed. Left front calibration point not reachable.
* XYZ calibration failed. Right front calibration point not reachable.
* XYZ calibration failed. Front calibration points not reachable.



### Troubleshooting

#### Bed calibration point was not found & Please consult the manual

Both of these error messages point to the same source. The printer was unable to find any of the calibration points. Therefore, there is almost for sure something wrong with the assembly. Don't re-assemble your printer just yet, but see the troubleshooting points of the following articles.

#### Left, Right, or Front calibration points not reachable

Unlike the other error messages related to the calibration, in this one, the printer was actually able to find some calibration points, but not all of them. However, troubleshooting remains the same. As that is the only way how to easily find out where the problem lies.

Before you start, remove the steel sheet if you own the Original Prusa i3 MK3 or MK2.5.

1. Go to LCD Menu -> Calibration -> Auto home.
2. Inspect where the PINDA sensor ends up. It must be within the First calibration point.
3. After checking the 1st calibration point, move the extruder with your hand, to the other end of the heatbed and inspect the 2nd calibration point.
4. If the PINDA sensor wasn't inside of any of the circles. Follow the instructions in the PINDA sensor misaligned.

# [End-stop not hitting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/end-stop-not-hitting_2035)

Your printer suspects that everything is not in perfect order with your **end-stops.**

### Wiring issue

Make sure there is not a wiring-issue with the X/Y end-stop on the mini RAMBo board.

Go to the LCD menu -> Calibration -> Show End stops. Once you are in this menu, manually click on the X/Y End-stops one by one. During this procedure, monitor if there is an appropriate change on the LCD.

Once pressing

**X end-stop**

= X shall change from 0 -> 1

Once pressing

**Y end-stop**

= Y shall change from 0 -> 1

If the procedure above went alright. Then one of your **end-stops** just can not be reached/triggered. That means there is some assembly/mechanical issue that prevents proper movement.

### X/Y End-stops out of position.

More common is that the X/Y End-stops were not installed correctly during the assembly.

The easiest way to check that is by doing the following:

1. You can easily click the **end-stops** when manually moving with Extruder or Heated bed, by hand.
2. Inspect that nothing is blocking the path around the **Smooth rods** and **Heated bed cables**.
3. With MK2S, it is wise to check that your **Extruder cables** are not hitting the mini RAMBo box. If they are, then re-adjust them.

# [Selftest failed (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-failed-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2045)

The Selftest checks for issues in the assembly of the printer, its wiring and the electronic components. It is the first part of the Calibration Wizard, which is prompted **automatically** when you turn on the printer for the first time or after a [Factory reset (MK2S/MK2.5S/MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mk2s-mk2-5s-mk3s_2216). After the initial calibration, the Selftest can be found at _LCD Menu - > Calibration -> Selftest._

### Selftest procedure checks

1. **Extruder and print fan** functionality
2. **Heatbed** and **hotend** wiring
3. **XYZ motors** wiring and functionality
4. **XY axis** length
5. **XY belts** tension
6. **Loose belt pulley**
7. **Filament sensor / IR sensor**



Progress and results of each step are displayed on the LCD screen. In case the process runs into an issue, the LCD screen will display an error message. All errors are described below.

### Selftest error messages

#### Extruder & Print fan test

_Front print fan/Left hotend fan - Not spinning:_

The MK3 Selftest procedure is capable of telling you which of the fans doesn't work. Simply check the one that is diagnosed as **not OK**.

1. Make sure that both of your fans are connected according to the [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107).
2. Check for any blockage that could prevent either of the fans from spinning.
3. Go over the wiring and make sure that none of the zip-ties is overtightened, which prevents the fans from spinning.



#### Heatbed & Hotend test

_Please check/ Not connected - Heater/ Thermistor:
Bed/ Heater - Wiring error:_

1. Make sure that both thermistors and heater are connected properly according to the [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107).
2. Check your heated bed cables and confirm they are not damaged by an overtightened zip-tie.
3. Make sure that your heated bed thermistor is firmly attached underneath the **Golden Kapton** tape.



#### XY axis length test

_Please check: Axis length - Axis {XYZ}:_

1. Start the Selftest routine again in **LCD Menu - Calibration - Selftest.** Carefully observe, whether no obstacles are blocking the path on any of the axis.
2. Pay attention to extruder cable management and the assembly of the printer's axes. **The most common cause of an improper X-axis movement is the cable harness hitting the EINSY/Mini RAMBo cover.**
3. Check that you can move the axis by hand, smoothly, in both directions. If movement is not smooth, try to lubricate the rods as shown in [Maintenance tips](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/maintenance-tips_23200).



#### Loose belt pulley test

1. Make sure that both pulleys are properly tightened, on the flat side of the motor-rod. Give the pulley a light tug. If any of them are loose, then the motor's shaft won't be able to move the axis.
2. Make sure that the belts aren't extremely loose, as they might be going around the pulleys without actually moving either of the axes.
3. Check that you can move the axis by hand, smoothly, in both directions. If movement is not smooth, try to lubricate the rods as shown in [Maintenance tips](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/maintenance-tips_23200).



#### Filament sensor test

_Filament sensor wiring error_

Make sure the Filament sensor functioning and is connected, according to [our illustrated article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-troubleshooting-mk2-5s-mk3s_112226).

# [Selftest failed (MK2/S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-failed-mk2-s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2049)

The first thing you need to do after assembling your printer is running the **Selftest** procedure. This routine checks for the most common issues in the build quality and electronics wiring.

For

**MK2.5/MK2.5S printers that have the SuperPINDA**

installed, you

**MUST use firmware version 3.9.3, or above!**

The Selftest prompt **appears automatically on the screen** once you turn on the printer for the first time. To start the **Wizard,** select **YES** by pressing the knob. You can manually start the Wizard at any time from the **LCD Menu - Calibration - Wizard.**

This procedure should not be necessary for pre-assembled printers.

After the initial calibration, the Selftest can be found in

_**LCD Menu - > Calibration -> Selftest**_

### Selftest procedure checks

1. **Extruder** and **print fan** functionality
2. **Heatbed** and **hotend** wiring
3. **XYZ motors** wiring and functionality
4. **XYZ endstop** mechanical settings and wiring axis length
5. **Loose belt pulley** test



Both progress and result of each step are displayed on the LCD screen. If the self-test process runs into an issue, the LCD screen will display a corresponding error message. All errors are described below.

### Self-test error messages (MK2/S)

#### Extruder & Print fan test

_Front print fan/ Left hotend fan - Not spinning:_

1. Make sure that both of your fans are correctly connected, as described in the [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109).
2. Check for any blockage that could prevent either of the fans from spinning.
3. Go over the wiring and make sure that none of the zip-ties is over-tightened, which prevents the fans from spinning.



#### Heatbed & Hotend test

_Please check/ Not connected - Heater/ Thermistor:Bed/ Heater - Wiring error:_

1. Make sure that both thermistors and heater are connected properly according to the [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109).
2. Check if your heated bed cables are not damaged by an overtightened zip-tie.
3. Investigate your Heated bed thermistor. It must be perfectly attached underneath the **Golden Kapton tape.**



#### XYZ endstop & motor test

1. Once this error is triggered, it means that either **X/Y end stops** or **X/Y motors** were not properly plugged in the mini RAMBo board.
2. Check the [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109) guide and move them to their proper position.



**Be aware that if both end stops are incorrectly mounted, Selftest will not be able to recognize the mistake. If you need to re-assemble the wiring, be extra careful.**

#### Loose belt pulley test

1. Make sure that both pulleys are properly tightened. If any of them is loose, then the motor's shaft won't be able to move the axis.
2. Make sure that your belt isn't extremely loose, as it might be just going around the pulley without actually moving either of the axes.

# [Distance between tip of the nozzle and the bed surface has not been set yet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/distance-between-tip-of-the-nozzle-and-the-bed-surface-has-not-been-set-yet_2052)

The "Distance between the tip of the nozzle and the bed surface has not been set yet" error message occurs after you successfully finish all of the calibration parts, **except** the First layer calibration.

Small adjustments can be later applied through the Live Z adjust option, even

**while printing**

. This menu can be entered only when printing the first 3 layers, just press the

**Knob - > Live adjust Z**

and then you can tune it.

# [Flexible materials](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flexible-materials_2057)

### Basic info

**Flexible materials** are characterized by their **excellent flexibility, tenacity, and chemical resistance**. These materials are relatively uncommon, expensive, and suitable mostly for advanced users due to high print difficulty.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 230 **°** C - 245 **°** C (Depending on hardness and brand).

**Recommended bed temperature:** 60 °C - 75 °C (Depending on the size of the object, bigger objects tend to need higher bed temperature).

### Description

[Flexible filaments](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/flex/) are **chemically and mechanically resistant** materials. Individual layers hold strongly together and there is a great print surface adhesion (applies only for TPU and TPEE). Due to these qualities, it is necessary to print on a powder-coated sheet or use a special separator on the print surface (glue stick or Kapton tape). Flexible filaments are **TPE** (thermoplastic elastomer) material, however, they are distributed under various names, such as **TPU, TPEE,** etc. For example, TPU is basically a subtype of TPE material and the main difference between TPU and TPE is its **shore hardness**. TPU is usually around 60A-90A on the shore hardness scale. Generally speaking, **the softer the filament is, the harder it is to print.**

_Shore hardness scale, source: smooth-on.com_

Flexible filaments are usually very **resistant to wear** (scratching), **stay flexible** even in cold environments, and show **great resistance against various solvents**. Dimensions are stable, there is **little to no shrinking or warping**. Their **tenacity and tensile strength are excellent:** 3D-printed parts can withstand great stress before breaking. These properties make it suitable for printing spacing washers and other high-stress parts. With proper print settings, you could print stamps, RC tires, shoe soles, belts, etc.

Some very soft flex materials can bond to the bed too much and require the use of glue stick on the bed as a separator to prevent PEI damage. A good alternative is the

**Textured Spring-steel sheet**

.

Printing with flexible filaments is recommended **only for experienced makers** , considering various challenges during printing. We’re talking about frequent nozzle clogging, poor bridging and overhang characteristics, filament tangling into extruder gears, stringing, and oozing.

To compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ Dimensional stability (low shrinkage)

✖ Very bad bridging and overhangs

✔ High mechanical and chemical resistance

✖ Difficult support removal

✖ Hygroscopic material (absorbs moisture)

### Best use

The best use of flexible filament is for printing **spacing washers** and other high-stress parts. With proper print settings, you could print **stamps, RC tires, shoe soles, belts, etc.**

### **Important rules for successful printing with flexible filaments**

1. **Make sure the nozzle is unobstructed.** If you’re not sure, do a cold pull to clean it completely.
2. **Loosen the idler** so the gears push the filament through only very gently. If they press too hard, the filament might get entangled in the gears.
3. **If you print on a smooth or satin sheet, apply a separation layer on it** (glue stick or Kapton tape should work). The powder-coated TXT sheet does not need any separation layer - the print will stick just fine and can be easily removed without damaging the surface.
4. **Print slowly.** The slower, the better. A typical speed for flexible filaments is usually 20 mm/s, the maximal recommended speed is somewhere between 30 and 40 mm/s. With higher speeds, you risk clogging the nozzle or tangling filament into the gears. For Original Prusa printers, we recommend using the “Semiflex or Flexfill 98A” or “Filatech FilaFlex40” profiles that have proper speed settings.
5. **Increase the nozzle temperature by 5 °C** , this will lower filament resistance. Keep print cooling turned off.
6. **Keep the filament dry.** Flexible filaments tend to absorb moisture and can be hard to print when wet.



### **Tips for successful printing**

**Flexibility and slicer settings**

Do you need **better mechanical resistance?** Set more infill and perimeters in PrusaSlicer. But if you need to **retain the material flexibility** , try to lower the number of perimeters and top/bottom layers. However, keep in mind that flexible filaments are not good at bridging and overhangs. A combination of thin layers and poor bridging can lead to ugly holes and protrusions.

If you use a different program than [**PrusaSlicer**](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) **,** try to adjust retractions a little bit. With lower retractions, there is a lower risk of clogging the nozzle or filament tangling. It’s alright to **turn the retractions off** completely and then try to raise them and watch the results.

Supports may need more space in Z-axis. Try to **increase it to 0,3 mm**. Supports that are closer to your model might stick to it too strongly and might be difficult to remove. Increase 'XY separation between an object and its support to at least 100%.

Remember that automatic filament change might not work properly with flexible filaments.

# [ABS](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/abs_2058)

### Basic info

**ABS** is a technical material **suitable for printing mechanically stressed parts** , thanks to its high tenacity and temperature resistance. Its surface can be smoothed with **acetone**. The main disadvantage is significant warping and toxic fumes.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 255 °C

**Recommended bed temperature:** 100 °C, you can set the bed temperature between 80 to 110 °C depending on the size of an object (larger object means higher temperature).

**Heatbed: Use the smooth or powder-coated PEI sheet with a glue stick.**

### Description

[**ABS**](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/asa-abs/) (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is basically a **predecessor of** [**ASA**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/asa_1809). ABS is generally used for making inexpensive, sturdy mechanical parts (LEGO bricks, car parts, cellphone parts, etc.). The material is **tenacious and temperature resistant** \- this makes it suitable for engineering parts, etc. Compared to ASA, there is slightly worse UV resistance and more significant warping and odor during printing. Note that ABS parts used outdoor turn yellowish and more brittle over time.

ABS printing requires specific conditions for successful results. It’s important to run the prints in a well-ventilated room because the material releases fumes and substances that could pose a potential health risk. However, when ventilating the room, do not create a draft around the print – this will negatively impact the result.

To compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ High tenacity & mechanical resistance

✔ High temperature-resistance

✖ Requires printer enclosure

✖ Potentially dangerous fumes (styrene)

✔ Possibility of acetone smoothing and gluing

### Best use

The best use of ABS is for printing cheap technical parts requiring good heat and mechanical resistance or parts that need to be acetone smoothed.

### **Tips for successful printing**

**Try to keep a high ambient temperature**

The bed should be heated at least up to 100 °C, **the printer should be inside an enclosure** with a higher ambient temperature.

If you don’t have an enclosure, there’s one simple alternative: in **PrusaSlicer** , set the skirt value as high as possible. This will keep the model slightly warmer and mitigate the warping. Printing inside an enclosure can lead to deformation of the [fan shroud](https://www.prusa3d.com/cs/produkt/fan-shroud-bl-mk3s-mmu2s-mk2-5s/) and other plastic parts. This can affect the printer's functionality. In case your plastic parts tend to deform, we recommend printing them from a more temperature resistant material, for example [**Prusament PC Blend**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/polycarbonate-pc_165812).

You should keep in mind that **ABS-printed parts tend to shrink slightly** after cooldown. We recommend printing a testing object and comparing it with a source model. The shrinkage factor of this material is somewhere around 1-2%.

When removing prints with a large surface area, it is very important to let the part and sheet cool properly. **You may have to assist the process using a spatula.** Be gentle when flexing the sheet and removing the print as the smooth PEI foil can tear.

If you print with [**MMU2S**](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mmu2s-upgrade-kit-for-mk2-5-mk3s-org/), you can use [HIPS](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hips_167118) for printing supports - this material has similar print settings to ABS and can be easily dissolved in limonene.

ABS can be sanded wet and dry and smoothed with acetone fumes, just like ASA (see more in our [article about chemical smoothing](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/improve-your-3d-prints-with-chemical-smoothing_36268/))

# [PETG](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/petg_2059)

### Basic info

**PETG** is one of the most easily printable materials, it is **inexpensive and suitable for beginners**. Relatively high tenacity and temperature resistance make it **suitable for printing technical parts** (for example parts of our printers).

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 230 °C for the first layer, 240 °C for the other layers

**Recommended bed temperature:** 85 °C for the first layer, 90 °C for the other layers

**Heatbed:** Using powder-coated TXT or satin sheet is highly recommended. Printing on smooth PEI surface might damage the sheet.

### Description

[**PETG**](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/prusament-petg/) (Polyethylene Terephthalate modified with Glycol) is a commonly used technical material, popular among 3D printer users for its **low price and good printability**. It’s tenacious, with good temperature resistance; PETG is most commonly used for printing various mechanical parts, holders, clamps, and waterproof parts (thanks to great layer adhesion).

PETG has a glossy surface, adheres greatly to a print sheet, and **does not shrink or warp** (it has very little thermal expansion), therefore it’s suitable for printing large models. Plus, its high tenacity and flexibility often **prevent it from breaking.** Due to good temperature resistance, PETG parts are suitable both for interior and most exterior use (with temperatures below 80 °C). **Parts of our printers are made of PETG!**

The letter G in PETG means that it’s modified with glycol during the manufacturing process. Glycol makes PET less brittle, easier to print, and more transparent for translucent prints. Of course, you can print also with PET filaments without glycol. However, printing with only PET is challenging and does not offer any advantage whatsoever.

Even though PETG in itself may be considered

[food-safe](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/food-safe-fdm-printing_112313)

, it consists of layers, as every 3D print, in which bacteria can grow over time. You can prevent this by applying a

**food-safe(epoxy) coating.**

Also, a stainless-steel nozzle should be used for if food is the intended application.

Although **PETG** is frequently used in **food industry** and is considered **food-safe** , we do not recommend it (or any other filament) for printing dishes or other stuff that comes into direct contact with food. The main reason is tiny print layer surface grooves that can support numerous bacterial colonies. But if you still want 3D printed dishes, we suggest **applying a special layer** that seals the surface (food-safe coating) and printing with a clean steel nozzle.

Some of the manufacturers **enrich PETG with various additives** and sell these materials under different names. For example, Spoolworks EDGE by E3D is modified PET/Copolyester Blend with additives. The goal is to acquire better visual qualities, surface and layer adhesion, etc.

To compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✖ Possibility of stringing

✖ Poor bridging and overhangs

✖ Not great for printing detailed parts

✖ Bonds strongly to the print surface

✔ High temperature-resistance

✖ Soluble in dangerous chemicals

✔ Water and humidity resistant

✖ Supports are hard to remove

### Best use

PETG is used universally but is especially suitable for mechanical parts for both indoor and outdoor use. We use PETG to print parts for our printers! Plastic bottles are also made from this kind of material.

### Tips for successful printing

**Temperature settings and cooling**

Unlike PLA, **PETG requires a heated bed (85 °C).** Its bridging- and overhang-behavior is usually worse, plus it is prone to stringing. Stringing can be moderated with higher retractions and lower nozzle temperature, but we suggest **using the PrusaSlicer profiles that should work fine.** It’s important to **cool the PETG print** \- this helps to keep the model detailed and prevents stringing and oozing. But if you want the model to be as tough as possible, try to turn off the print fan. Higher filament temperature improves merging between layers which leads to better mechanical resistance. Otherwise, we recommend printing the first few layers with the print fan off to prevent deformation, then with the fan running at half its power.

**Do not print on the smooth PEI sheet**

as the adhesion may be too strong!

**Print surface preparation**

Make sure the print surface is clean, as described in [our dedicated article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804). It is advisable to use one of the **powder-coated print sheets. Do not print on the smooth PEI sheet** as the adhesion may be too strong! If you decide to use the smooth PEI sheet anyway, apply a glue stick on it before printing.

**Adding more perimeters for more solid parts**

If you want to print truly solid parts, **try to increase the number of perimeters** instead of adding more infill.

### Postprocessing

PETG can be easily sanded both dry and wet.

**Dissolving and smoothing PETG** is possible only in a laboratory by skilled lab workers using **dangerous chemicals** (Dichloromethane).

# [PLA](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pla_2062)

### **Basic info**

**PLA** is one of the **easiest materials to print.** It is inexpensive and suitable (not only) for beginners. It’s usually used for printing detailed models, figures, and quick prototypes that don’t require high mechanical, chemical, or temperature resistance.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 215 °C for the first layer, 210 °C for other layers

**Recommended bed temperature:** 60 °C

**Heatbed:** Smooth PEI sheet will provide the best adhesion.

### Description

[**PLA**](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/prusament-pla/) (Polylactic acid) is a plant-based polyester. **PLA does not require a heated bed** , can be printed fast and with low temperatures (melting point is somewhere around 175 °C). With PLA you can print both small, detailed models and large objects filling almost the entire print volume. Unlike some other filaments, **PLA is not prone to significant warping**. It is good for quick prototyping and creation of nice, low-cost models: concepts, prototypes, simple toys, jewelry, statues, etc. It is not suitable for technical and outdoor use. It doesn’t resist high temperatures (it gets soft and deform at temperatures over 60 °C), degrades under UV light and its mechanical resistance is also inferior - it breaks by the layers or into shards upon impact. Layer adhesion is weaker compared to other materials. Sanding PLA is possible with sandpaper but needs water cooling (wet sanding).

Various sources claim that **PLA is biologically degradable**. The material is made from corn, sugar cane, or sugar beet and indeed can be decomposed, but only in specialized composting facilities where temperatures exceed 80 °C. It is definitely **not a good idea** to throw the **PLA** waste into your garden compost - the material will not disintegrate, plus you will contaminate the soil with plastic microparticles.

Although the **PLA** material itself is **food-safe** , we do not recommend it (or any other filament material) for printing dishes or other stuff that comes into direct contact with food. The main reason is tiny print layers/grooves that can support bacterial growth. If you still want 3D printed dishes or food containers, we suggest applying a **special layer that seals the surface** (food-safe coating) and printing with a stainless steel nozzle.

To compare supported material properties, see our [**material table.**](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ Easy to print, suitable for beginners

✖ Low UV and temperature resistance

✔ Good detail and low warping

✖ Difficult post-processing

✔ Suitable for large models

### Best use

The best use of PLA is for printing concept models, prototypes, or low-wear toys.

### Tips for successful printing

**Consider using a smooth PEI sheet**

If you print with PLA on our Original Prusa i3 printers, **you can print on either a smooth, powder-coated TXT or powder-coated satin sheet.** However, the smooth sheet works better for printing parts that have a small contact area with the print surface. With a powder-coated sheet, you should move your live-Z lower: Filament must fill in the sheet texture. However, you need to be careful and not move the nozzle too low or you will damage your sheet! **Info for different printer users:** PLA is printable not only on PEI surface, but also on glass, Kapton tape, or using a glue stick.

**Try to adjust retractions for better results**

PLA is sometimes prone to stringing and oozing - this can be reduced with proper retraction settings.

[Chemical smoothing](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/improve-your-3d-prints-with-chemical-smoothing_36268/)

of PLA is possible only in

**laboratory conditions**

\- PLA can be dissolved in

**chloroform, hot benzene, or tetrahydrofuran.**

These are dangerous organic solvents that should be handled only by skilled lab technicians. Some of the PLA filaments can be also partially dissolved and

**glued with acetone**

(or you can simply glue it with superglue).

# [PTFE tubes in Original Prusa i3 printers](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ptfe-tubes-in-original-prusa-i3-printers_2065)

### What is PTFE and where do I find it?

Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a synthetic material, similar to Teflon (and closely related to it). Thanks to their low friction coefficient, tubes from this material are used to guide filament in all Original Prusa i3 printers. Not all the tubes are the same, multi-material printers often require narrow and more precise tubes, than the single-material printer. Before your order or make a new tube, make sure you have the correct dimensions.

**In general, we distinguish between :**

A) the tubes for the hotend, which are inside the extruder (common for all printers)

B) the tubes guiding the filament to the extruder (mostly for the multi-material printers)

### How to remove and check the PTFE tube?

Most of the tubes can be easily removed using your hand. However, the tubes in hotends require a partial printer disassembly. Learn how to change/inspect the PTFE tube in hotend for the [MK3/MK2.5](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-ptfe-tube-mk3-mk2-5_17360), and for the [MK3S/MK2.5S/MMU2S](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-ptfe-tube-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_21664).

###

### My tube is damaged, what now?

In case your printer is jammed and the tube is damaged, you have three options:

1. Check your original shipping package, we include some PTFE tubes as spare (e.g. with MMU2)
2. Visit our online store and check for the spare tubes, at our [E-shop](https://www.prusa3d.com/) (you have to be logged in)
3. Find a local dealer of the PTFE tubes. To make your own follow [How to trim PTFE tube - Original Prusa printers](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-trim-ptfe-tube-original-prusa-printers_22424) guide.



Prusa Research recommends purchasing PTFE tubes manufactured by company Festo, which provides the highest quality and precision. You can also use tubes from E3D, but please always check the internal dimensions and compare them to the

# [Changing or replacing the nozzle (MK2.5S/MK3S/MK3S+/MK3.5)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/changing-or-replacing-the-nozzle-mk2-5s-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5_2069)

The Original Prusa i3 printers use the E3D V6 Hotend. Any nozzle that is compatible with the E3D V6 Hotend can be installed on it. The stock nozzle that accompanies the printer is an E3D V6 0.4 mm brass nozzle, but other types and [diameters](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/everything-about-nozzles-with-a-different-diameter_8344/) can be used as well. **The following procedure applies to all nozzles, except the Olsson Ruby.**

### Why change the nozzle?

There might be two main reasons for replacing the nozzle:

* The nozzle is worn out and needs a replacement.
* You want to print using a different nozzle type, and/or diameter.



Unless you print abrasive materials with a brass nozzle, the stock brass nozzle will last you many hundreds of printing hours. Changing a relatively new nozzle to resolve a clog is not the solution!

* 2.5 mm Allen key (Included with assembled printers and kits)
* 7 mm spanner/socket or pliers (7 mm spanner/socket not included with assembled printers and kits)
* 17 mm spanner (not included with assembled printers and kits)
* Small plate or aluminium foil (not included with assembled printers and kits)



### Procedure

The following procedure assumes that a firmware version from 3.12.0 or above is installed. In case your printer has a previous firmware version, we recommend [upgrading to the latest version](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk3s-mk3s-mk3_2227). If you did not flash a newer firmware version, follow the procedure, except for "Step 3 alternative" instead of step 3.

**Follow this procedure exactly!** Omitting steps can cause leaking and extrusion issues outlined at the end of this article.

1. Unload the filament, if it is loaded, from _LCD Menu - Unload Filament_. Optionally, perform a [Cold pull (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mk3s-mk2-5s_2075).
2. Navigate to _LCD Menu - Settings - HW Setup - Nozzle Change_.
1. The printer will display a message with a link to this guide.
2. **Click the LCD encoder** : the printer will auto-home, and subsequently move the Z axis to the topmost position, and the X axis to the center. In the meantime, the printer will automatically heat the nozzle to **280 °C**. Heating the nozzle is essential for this process.
3. Once the nozzle is at **280 °C** , the printer screen will display the following message: " **Hotend at 280C! Nozzle changed and tightened to specs?** ". Do not click on the LCD encoder for now.
3. Unscrew the two screws on the print fan and the single screw securing the fan shroud. Remove both parts (picture below).



Step 2 alternative: if you could not follow step 3 due to firmware version up to 3.11.0 being installed, gain better access to the nozzle by moving the extruder (Z-axis) as high as possible: go to _LCD Menu - Settings - Move Axis - Move Z_. Spin the **Knob** to adjust the height. Once this is done, preheat the nozzle to **280 °C** from _LCD Menu - Settings - Temperature - Nozzle_. Heating the nozzle is essential for this process.

CAUTION: Heated parts can cause severe burns!

4. Hold the heater block with a 17 mm spanner (M10) or adjustable wrench.



Be extra careful around the

**fragile**

hotend heater and thermistor wires. You can break them off or

**short-circuit the heater with your spanner!**

5. Unscrew the nozzle using the supplied pliers. If you are using the E3D nozzles from our online store, use a 7mm spanner (M4) or 7 mm socket. **Be careful, the nozzle is still hot! Place it out of the way on your non-flammable surface.**
6. Make sure that the printer is still on the screen described in step 3c, and that the set temperature (280 °C) didn't change. Holding the heater block with your spanner, carefully screw the new nozzle in and tighten it gently, but firmly. **Do not use excessive force!**



Our service and assembly teams use a torque wrench rated for 1 - 5 N m and

**tighten the nozzle with a force of 2.5 N m**

(Newton Meter).

### Final inspection

**There must always be a gap (~0.5 mm)** between the nozzle and the heater block (left picture). The nozzle must be tightened/secured in the heater block, and **locked against the heat break** while heated (right picture). Failing to do so will cause leaks (center picture).

You can find this procedure as

[a video on our YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/txt6sxV6X88)

. Be aware that some steps may differ slightly from the procedure outlined here, and printed parts of the extruder may look a little different than yours.

# [i3 Printer Regular Maintenance](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/i3-printer-regular-maintenance_2072)

It is recommended to regularly take some time to maintain your printer. This should be done even if the printer is working perfectly. **The inspection and maintenance of its various components should be done every couple of hundred hours of print-time.** This guide is valid for all the Original Prusa i3 printers, i.e. MK3S+, MK3s, MK3, MK2.5S, MK2.5, MK2S, and Plus 1.75 mm. **
**

You can check the number of printing hours from your printer in the

_LCD menu - Statistics_

.

**Besides the usual tools, such as Allen keys, needle-nose pliers, and IPA + paper towels, you might need:**

* **Lubricant:** the best option is the Prusa lubricant. One is sent with the printer, but it can also be found in our [e-shop](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-lubricant-applicator-set-5g/). Other recommended lubricants are Super Lube 210XX, GLEIT-µ HF 400, and Mogul LV 2-EP. We do not recommend lubricants with a very high viscosity.



**Do not apply lubricant on the trapezoid nuts or the threaded lead screws of the Z-axis!**

* **Compressed air:** also known as canned air. Be sure to not hold it upside down while spraying - otherwise, you could damage any electronic components while trying to clean them.
* **Brush:** a small brass brush is an ideal tool for cleaning the Bondtech filament pulleys. If you don't have a brass brush any brush with hard bristles will do the job. Alternative: You can use the acupuncture needle that comes with the printer or a toothpick.



### Axes check

**What to check on your printer:**

* **Smooth rods:** scratches/grooves - take each rod between two/three fingers and move them slowly from one end of the rod to another, while rotating the fingers around the rod. If you notice any scratch, verify it with your fingernail.
* **Bearings:** Clean and lubricate the bearings and rods as shown [this guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/maintenance-tips_23200). Despite cleaning and lubricating the smooth rods, it can happen that the axes' movement is still not smooth. In this case, please remove the bearings from the printer and lubricate them from the inside with a pea-sized amount of lubricant.



Screws on the back of the extruder (X-carriage-back) or the U-bolts, should NOT be overtightened, as this might deform the bearings and cause scratches on the smooth rods.

* **Belt pulleys:** any debris around the belt pulleys and belts should be immediately removed to ensure smooth operations. Also, check if the set screw of the belt pulley is firmly secured on the flat side of the motor shaft.
* **Idler screw** (M3x40 with the spring on it) is not overtightened or too loose. Generally, the head of the screw, on the left side, should be about flush with the printed parts of the extruder. Details on the ideal tension of the idler screw can be found in [Idler screw tension](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/idler-screw-tension_177367).
* **Y- and X-axis belts:** Both of the belts should be tight enough to sound like a low bass note when plucked. On the MK3/S/+, the belt status can be checked in the _LCD menu - Support - Belt status_. Recommended values are between 260 and 290. For details on adjusting the belt tension [please see this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mk3-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5-mk4_112380).



### Flexible steel sheet

Acetone should be used sparingly for cleaning, and only be used on the Smooth steel sheet!

**Never use acetone on the Textured or Satin steel sheet**

as the surface will be permanently damaged.

All flexible steel sheets should be cleaned regularly to ensure adhesion, but the exact methods and washing solutions can differ depending on your type of sheet.

You can find more information on how to take care of your flexible steel sheet [in this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flexible-steel-sheets-guidepost_2195).

### Fans

The Original Prusa i3 MK3/S/+ can spot if any of the fans stop spinning. However, that does not mean you should not check them during maintenance. Dust or plastic build-up can decrease their efficiency or even damage them.

A cotton swab can also be used to clean off dust and debris from the propeller or canned air will clear the dust. Tweezers can be used to take out any plastic strands. **Hold the propeller** **of the fan to prevent it from spinning while cleaning it with canned air**. Otherwise, it can get damaged. Clear away any debris that may be stuck and check that it can rotate freely.

### Extruder driver gear

The MK2.5/S and MK3/S/+ printers are equipped with two Bondtech gears, made of hardened carbon steel. One is the **pulley gear,** secured on the extruder's motor shaft by a set screw. The other is the **idler gear** , which spins freely mounted on the idler door. **If you have had a clog, they can also have collected residue grinding the filament** which will, in turn, reduce their grabbing force on the filament.

**Regular cleaning and lubrication will:**

* Reduce wear and noise.
* Increase the grabbing force on the filament.
* Lower friction between the two pulley gears.
* Protect against rust.



If you're cleaning the gear inside the extruder without removing the extruder motor first, be sure to cover the PTFE tube to avoid any debris falling in. You can use a cotton swab - it will reliably cover the tube without damaging it). After you're done cleaning, give it a good puff of air to clear any remains, while the PTFE tube is still covered.

Open the Extruder idler door by releasing the screw(s) on the left side of your extruder.

Both hobbed gears can have a build-up of filament shavings stuck in the grooves. Using a brass brush, clean what you can, then rotate the gear a few degrees and repeat until you do a full turn. They can also be cleaned one at a time using the acupuncture needle that comes with the printer.

The gears can be covered by rust. There is no need to worry. The gears themselves should not be damaged. Remove any problematic bits of filament and clean them with a brush.

Make sure the Bondtech pulley gear is aligned with the path of the filament and secured on the flat side of the motor shaft. Also, check that the shaft of the idler gear goes through both "ears" of the Extruder-Idler-door plastic part and spins freely. You can find a more detailed guide in [Checking/re-aligning the Bondtech gear (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/checking-re-aligning-the-bondtech-gear-mk3s-mk2-5s_133176).

Apply a tiny amount of the grease only to the teeth protruding outwards from the gear. **Make sure that the lubricant never gets in contact with the filament teeth.** Do not use oil-based lubricant as it may spread to unwanted sections, like where the filament is fed into the hotend.

### Electronics

**On the MK2/S and MK2.5/S** \- Check and reconnect the electrical connectors on the [miniRAMBo board](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109) **after the first 50 hours of printing and then every 150-200 hours.**

**On the MK3/S/+** \- Check and reconnect the electrical connectors on the [EinsyRAMBo board](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107) **every 600 - 800 hours of printing.**

Before touching the electrical connections, please make sure that the printer is off, and unplugged from the main power source.

* Check if there are any pinched or worn cables on the printer.
* Open the electronics casing and blow compressed air in between the cables to get rid of dust.
* Check the connection of all of the wires on the [mini RAMBo board](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109) or [EINSY RAMBo board](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107). Especially pay attention to the cables from the PSU (power source) and heaters. Make sure they are inserted all the way in and well-tightened.
* Users of the **Original Prusa i3 MK2/S** and **MK2.5/S** need to pay special attention to the printer's power-input and heatbed's power connectors. Make sure both the connector and socket are not damaged in any way.
* Users of the **Original Prusa i3 MK3/S/+** should lightly tug the power and heatbed connectors. If any movement is felt, then re-tighten the screws.



### Nozzle change

Putting an exact number on how long a nozzle will last is very difficult, as it depends on how much you print, what types of filament you use, and how often you change between filament types. **It is not the first thing you should look to if you are experiencing extrusion issues** , but if the printer has been in use for more than 3-6 months and you are getting poor print quality, even after doing the mentioned maintenance, you may want to consider [replacing the nozzle](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/changing-or-replacing-the-nozzle-mk2-5s-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5_2069).

### Firmware and software

You should always be using the latest **stable** firmware version that we have published for your specific printer model. You can check the firmware version you have in the _LCD menu - Support_.

We also recommend using the latest version of our [PrusaSlicer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/install-prusaslicer_1903), as it enables you to **enjoy all the features of your printer**. It even saves information about the printer model, nozzle diameter, and firmware version directly into the g-code file so that the printer can warn you if anything is out of date or incompatible.

# [Cold pull (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mk3s-mk2-5s_2075)

A 'cold pull' is a technique that allows you to clean your printer’s nozzle and hotend from any material that may be stuck or burnt inside. You can also use it to clean your hotend during your usual maintenance routine.

If you are using Nozzle X,

**do not**

use the cold-pull method, but only use cleaning filament.

The cold pull should be made if your nozzle is only partially clogged, and some filament is still being extruded. If the nozzle is completely clogged, please check the [Clogged nozzle guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3-5-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008).

Our testing has found that

**PLA works best for a cold pull,**

as other filaments do not retain the tip as PLA does and they will either tear or melt too much. However, there are filaments specifically made for cleaning hotends.

### Procedure

1. Go to the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> Temperature -> Nozzle_ and set the temperature to 270 °C.
2. While waiting for the nozzle to reach the temperature, toggle the **Filament autoload** off in the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> F. autoload._
3. Still being in the _Menu_ , go to _Settings_ and choose _Disable steppers_. _There is no message of the steppers being disabled, but you may hear an electrical hiss disappear when selected. **If you can move the bed or extruder on its axis by hand, they are disabled.**_
4. Open the Extruder Idler door. _Unscrew the screws circled below using a 2.5 mm Allen key. On the MMU2S, unscrew the Bowden PTFE tube that connects the MMU unit with the extruder._


5. Once it has reached 270 °C, insert PLA filament manually into the extruder and push it in until it starts pouring out of the nozzle.
6. Stop heating by pressing _Cooldown_ in the _LCD Menu - > Preheat_ (scroll all the way down), or by pressing the reset (X) button. Let the nozzle temperature drop to room temperature. _To speed up the cooling you can engage the print fan at full speed, from LCD menu - > Settings -> Temperatures -> Fan speed -> [255]._
7. Continue manually pushing the filament down until the temperature is too low for it to melt and come out (around 170 °C for PLA). _The nozzle has to be filled for the cold pull to be successful._
8. Pick away extruded material so there is nothing obstructing the pull later on.
9. After the nozzle cools down to the room temperature, go again to the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> Temperature -> Nozzle_ and set the temperature to 85 °C.
10. **As soon as the extruder reaches this temperature** , grab the filament with pliers and pull it slowly but steadily out of the extruder. _The filament can break inside. Make sure to pull straight upwards, not sideways. Hold the extruder with your other hand._
11. Don't stop until the filament is completely pulled out from the extruder.



### Results

On the tip of the filament that has been pulled out, you may see remnants of the previous material(s) you have been using or some burnt dirt that has settled in the nozzle (left picture). You might want to repeat this procedure several times until the filament comes out clean.

The right picture shows what a clean cold-pulled filament should look like. It is important to have the imprint of the nozzle on it, this way you are sure the nozzle was filled and nothing was left inside. Also, the color is not mixed with the one you have been using previously or have dark marks on it.

### After the procedure

Secure the idler door by having **the head of the idler screw** , on the left of the extruder, **about flush with the plastic parts, when the filament is not loaded.** Then we recommend running the Z calibration ( _LCD menu - > Calibration -> Calibrate Z_) as pushing on the extruder might have thrown it off balance. Also, turn Autoload of filament back on, if you prefer this feature.

Please see

# [Testing safety features (MK3/MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/testing-safety-features-mk3-mk3s_2079)

Our brand new **Original Prusa i3 MK3** comes with lots of new safety features. That makes printing a lot more reliable and safe. In this article, we will showcase how to properly test all of them and how to debug them.

All of these features must be tested **during a running print.** You can use models from the bundled SD card, for instance, the **Batman** or **Prusa logo.**

### Filament sensor

#### How to test the filament sensor

1. First, you must make sure that the Filament sensor is turned on. You can check that in the **LCD Menu - Settings - Fil. sensor ON/OFF.**
2. Let the print run for 5-10 minutes, then simply **cut the filament** and wait until the sensor triggers it.
3. The printer will then ask you to **press the knob** and unload the filament.
4. After that, simply load a new filament into the extruder. Either by **pressing the knob** or if you have the autoload turned on, it will be done automatically.
5. If changed correctly. Select **YES**. If you did not load the filament, select **Filament not load** or if the color is not clear select **Color not clear.**



#### False sensor reading and debugging

1. Check if the sensor is positioned correctly and **connectors are properly seated.**
2. Make sure that there is no **dust on the sensor** or **extreme light conditions.**
3. For more information, see [IR Filament Sensor (MK2.5S, MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-mk2-5s-mk3s_112214).



### Skipped steps and layer detection

#### How to test the "crash" detection

1. Make sure that your printer is running in the **normal mode.** You can check that in **LCD - Settings - Mode Normal/Stealth** and that the crash detection is enabled in **LCD - Settings - Crash** det **. ON/OFF.**
2. **Pinch** the smooth rods close to the extruder, which will result in stopping it while printing.
3. **Do not** push the extruder. As this does not simulate a real printing scenario.
4. If done properly, the extruder will **auto home** and restore printing automatically.



#### The printer is not recognizing hits and skips

1. Double-check that you are running the printer in the normal mode.
2. Make sure that your belt and pulley are tightened. Would any of them be loose, it may cause the belt to **jump** over the pulley or the pulley to **spin** around the motor shaft.
3. If the crash detection does not work, you can visit [Layer shifting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layer-shifting_2020) for more information. (Layer shifting has a lot in common with none working crash detection.)



### Power panic

#### How to test power panic

1. Do not use the **power switch.** That does not trigger power panic.
2. You can pull the power cord from the wall. However, it may not work all the time. **Best practice** is to have a **power strip** with an ON/OFF switch.
3. So simply **switch off** the power strip in the middle of your print.
4. The printer will then raise the nozzle and once the power is back, it will heat up and restore printing without user interaction.
5. **If the power goes off for a longer period of time and the nozzle/bed is cool. The printer will wait for you and ask if you want to restore printing.**



#### Power panic did not trigger or work

1. If it did not trigger while **unplugging** the power cord (which we do not recommend). It may have been caused by **arcing** produced by the cord.
2. **Nozzle did not rise far enough.**
1. Make sure that you are running **the newest** firmware version. The actual firmware version running on your printer can be found in the **LCD menu under _Support - > Firmware_. **The latest version can be always found at our [Downloads page](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/downloads/).
2. Check your Z-axis assembly. Any extra friction might prevent the proper Z movement.

# [Print fan is not spinning](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/print-fan-is-not-spinning_2081)

**The print fan is the fan blowing on the printed object, right below the nozzle.** Depending on the material and where you are in the print it might not always spin at full speed or at all. There is also an [error in the firmware connected to the fan not spinning](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/err-print-fan-error_2159). **If you did not receive any error but the fan does not spin, you will probably find the solution in this article.**

_MK2/S, MK2.5/S, MK3/S/+ print fan ( green circle)_ _MINI/MINI+ print fan ( blue arrows)_

You can easily test the print fan function from the

**_LCD menu - > Settings -> Temperature -> Fan speed_. **

Always test with

**at least 50% power**

(value 127-255)

**.**

When you select the speed, confirm by pressing the knob.

### PrusaSlicer settings

**The print fan is never used during the first layer of any material.** It will start from layers 2-4, depending on the material profile selected. For example with PLA, the print fan is spinning at 100% all the time until the print finishes. For ASA and ABS, the fan is turned off completely for the first 4 layers then will only spin at 15-20%, with a slight increase when printing Bridges. At very low speeds the print fan can be almost inaudible.

_PLA settings - Fan always 100%_ _ASA settings - Fan only 20% at fewer layers._

### Further checks

**Make sure that the fan is:**

* Plugged into the right location
* Plugged in in the correct orientation
* Plugged in completely and making good electric contact



If the fan still doesn't spin up, you can unplug it from the electronics board and test it with the 12V DC (MK2/S) or 5V DC (MK3/S/+) power source. **If the fan spins up with an external power source** , check the electronics for your printer **and its fuses** :

---

# [Hotend fan is not spinning](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hotend-fan-is-not-spinning_2084)

This issue can be preceded by the error [Err: EXTR. FAN ERROR](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/err-extr-fan-error_2156). Before we start checking your Hotend fan, power down and unplug your USB cable if it's connected. Open the electronics covering and examine the [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109) or [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107).

#### Make sure that the fan is:

1. Plugged into the right connector.
2. Plugged in with the proper connector orientation.
3. Plugged in completely and making good electrical contact.



You can easily test the nozzle Hotend fan function from the LCD menu **Preheat - PLA.** From when the Hotend temperature reaches 50 °C, the fan should immediately spin up.

**On MK2.5S/MK3S** \- From the _LCD menu - Support - Extruder Info,_ you can find the RPM reading of the 3-wire fans that support this. **The expected range should be from ~3500 - 4200 RPM on both fans,** when run at full speed. Only the print fan speed can be adjusted by the user.

### When the Hotend fan should actually spin

Hotend cooling fan cools down the top part of the Hotend (heatsink) from the heat which is transferred from the heater block. **It always starts up when Hotend temperature reading reaches 50°C and spins for the whole duration of the print!** If the fan is not functioning, you can expect the nozzle to jam after the first few layers due to heat creep.

**Always make sure that the fan is pushing the air in through and around the heatsink and not out. The proper orientation of the hotend fan can be checked with the photo below.**

**Correct: Sticker facing inwards** **NOT Correct: Sticker facing outwards**

# [Heatbed not heating up properly](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/heatbed-not-heating-up-properly_2086)

If your Heatbed does not heat up, there are a couple of things you should check to identify the source of the issue.

### Temperature measurements

**Measuring the temperature with an IR thermometer is not the correct way to measure it.** It measures an average of a circle that is much bigger than the laser point in its center, so it may show significantly lower temp at the side of the heatbed. Furthermore, it also has a parameter called _emissivity_ , which is usually fixed for cheaper thermometers. To simplify emissivity, it measures different temperatures based on the surface.

There is a difference between the steel sheet temperature and heatbed bottom temperature (~5-10°C).

**The correct way to measure the temperature is a thermistor or contact temperature probe fixed to the sheet** with a bit of thermal paste. This may still measure around 5°C lower than the actual temperature.

### Initial checks

If you received an error, we recommend start checking the respective articles of that error, like:

If no error has presented itself, please proceed with the troubleshooting steps outlined below.

1. Visually check that your Heated bed is not badly damaged or does not have exposed traces. As long as the trace is not broken, as is shown in the right picture below, it can be fixed with a few layers of nail polish painted over it.



_Traces cut. Replacement required._ _Superficial scratch. Can be mended._

Even a small scratch can cause issues or electrical noise during heating.

2. Check that your Heated bed thermistor is properly attached under the **golden Kapton tape**. If you notice the thermistor is hanging freely, unattached to the bed, undo the 6-9 bolts holding the bed to the Y-carriage and re-secure the thermistor using Kapton tape.



_Correctly secured thermistor_ _Loose thermistor. Will not work!_

3. **Check the power connection:**



### Thermistor test

#### Hairdryer

The best and easiest way is to take a hairdryer and blow **hot air** in below the Heatbed. During this process, check if there is **any temperature change on the LCD.** If there is a change it means your thermistor is working. If there is no change at all, your thermistor is defective.

#### Swapping connections

If the hairdryer test is inconclusive you can test whether the port on the mainboard is damaged. Swap the connection of the Hotend thermistor and heatbed thermistor.

### IPA Test = uneven heating

To see whether the surface is heating evenly or at all, we suggest wiping down the heat bed surface with Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) cold and then heating the heatbed through the Preheat menu or _LCD menu - > Temperatures -> Bed_. The alcohol will evaporate when heated, exposing areas that are not heating at all.

### Slow preheat process

Remove the printed cover at the back left of the heated bed and check the following.

1. Damaged Heated bed cables at any spot.
2. PSU cables are properly attached to the miniRAMBO/EinsyRAMBO board and not damaged at any spot.



Usually, cables can be damaged around the Zip-ties, as this can cause stress on the cables if overtightened.

### Measuring resistance/voltage

The resistance of the heated bed thermistor should be **approximately 100K at room temperature** (the same goes for the thermistor on the hot end if you are curious!)

If you are unfamiliar with how to use a multimeter, we have an article on

[Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117)

.

The resistance of the heated bed should be:

*     *       * **1 Ohm on MK2/S**
* **3.4 Ohm on MK3/S**



### Measuring voltages

* The voltage going to the heated bed should be **~12V**
* The voltage coming from the PSU to the miniRAMBO should be **~12V** too


* The voltage going to the heated bed should be **~24V**
* The voltage coming from the PSU to the EinsyRAMBO should be **~24V** too



### Disconnect Power Panic

In some rare cases, the PowerPanic has interfered with the operation of **MK3/S/+**. If non of the steps outlined above resolves it, try to disconnect the PowerPanic cable from the EinsyRAMBo. Please see [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107) for what to disconnect.

# [P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA Sensor testing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/p-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing_2091)

P.I.N.D.A. stands for **P** rusa **IND** uction **A** utoleveling sensor and is a vital component facilitating the calibration of our printers. There are 3 different versions:

* **P.I.N.D.A. V1** \- used on MK2/S and MINI.
* **P.I.N.D.A. V2** \- used on MK2.5, MK2.5S, MK3, and MK3S.
* **SuperPINDA** \- Compatible/used with MK2.5/S, MK3/S/+, and MINI+.



The difference between P.I.N.D.A V1 and V2 is that the P.I.N.D.A V2 has an inbuilt thermistor to compensate for the difference in cold and hot measurements. **V1 and V2 are not interchangeable.** However, SuperPINDA and PINDA V2 are interchangeable but may require a firmware update. The SuperPINDA does not have a thermistor, as its high-quality components and manufacturing remove the need for one.

For

**MK2.5/MK2.5S printers that have the SuperPINDA**

installed, you

**MUST use firmware version 3.9.3, or above!**

In addition to this, you must let the printer know you have the SuperPINDA installed, and not the P.I.N.D.A. V2, by navigating to

_LCD Menu - > Settings -> HW settings -> SuperPINDA -> ON._ **MK3S & MK3S+ owners using the SuperPINDA must use firmware version 3.9.2, or above!**

### Testing the P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor

Firstly, we need to check if the sensor works at all. For this test, you need a small and thin metal object (spatula, scissors, pliers). Your printer should also be running on the latest [firmware version for your printer model](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk3s-mk3s-mk3_2227).

1. Press the knob next to the LCD for 3 sec and turn it to raise the extruder approximately 10 cm above the heatbed. This is to distance it from any metal.
2. If you have firmware version 3.5.3 and later (unless you have an MK2/S), go to the _LCD Menu - > Support -> Sensor info_ and see the sensor value ( _'PINDA:' 1_ or _0_ )



Before firmware version 3.5.3, the P.I.N.D.A. sensor value was found in _LCD Menu - > Calibration -> Show end stops_. If you have an MK2/S, you can find the Z-value there.

3. Place the metal object (spatula, screwdriver, etc.) underneath the P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor. The value should change from **0 to 1** , and the red light on top of the sensor should turn off.
4. Move the extruder by hand all along the X-axis and wiggle with the extruder's cable-bundle. The value should still be 1, as long as there is something metallic under the sensor.



One of the most frequent issues is an overtightened zip-tie, which causes the P.I.N.D.A. sensor cable to fail when it reaches a specific position. Double-check all the zip-ties and make sure they are not too tight.

### Testing the P.I.N.D.A. sensor-readings in Pronterface

There is another way to check whether or not the P.I.N.D.A. sensor works correctly. Please perform the following procedure 3 times. For the sake of consistent measurements, please make sure the tests are done under identical conditions. __

Pronterface may not be supported on newer versions of iOS (Apple Laptops) after they dropped the support of 32-bit apps with Catalina. However, there are some workarounds. See [this Github thread.](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun/issues/1016)

1. Connect the printer to your computer following the [Pronterface and USB cable](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pronterface-and-usb-cable_2222) guide.



Make sure the nozzle is clean, and the print surface is clear of any obstructions.

2. Issue a **G80-command** into the command-line. It triggers the mesh bed leveling process.
3. Once the process is complete, issue a **G81-command** which gives you a report of the interpolated Z values for a 7 x 7 array of values.



Compare the data arrays. Keep in mind that every number in the matrix has their pre-defined positions, always compare the numbers in the same position. You want to make sure there are no significant deviations (>0.2) between the 3 measurements.

After adjusting the P.I.N.D.A. sensor or any other hardware, we recommend running the Calibration Wizzard from the beginning.

# [Power Panic](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/power-panic_2092)

The printer can fully recover from a complete loss of power without the need for batteries or a UPS. A special sensor detects mains voltage, and in case of an interruption, it immediately shuts down the heatbed and extruder heating, leaving enough power in the capacitors to store the position and lift the print head away from the print. In case of a very short power failure, the printer will attempt to continue printing immediately without waiting for user interaction.

Keep in mind that power panic doesn't work if you use the on/off switch on the PSU

### Resuming the print

When the power comes back, the printer will give you an option to continue the print. Keep in mind that during extended periods without power, the bed will cool down and the printed object can detach itself from the sheet plate. So, before resuming the process, check the following:

1. Make sure that all objects are still attached to the steel sheet plate.
2. Follow the instructions on the LCD screen and resume the print.
3. Stay with the printer for about 10 minutes and make sure that the printing process continues without any problems.

# [SD card not working](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sd-card-not-working_2095)

Our Original Prusa i3 printers offer two ways of printing: via a USB cable or by loading g-codes from an SD card. If you are experiencing SD-card-related issues, try some of our tips below.

_"Card removed" message on the LCD screen._

If you have inserted your SD card into the SD card slot and the printer's LCD screen still says "Card removed", try the following steps:

1. Inspect the SD card slot and make sure there is **no debris or dust inside.**
2. Inspect the SD card itself, see if it's not damaged.
3. Make sure that the SD card is **correctly inserted.** _The right orientation has the card's pins facing towards you._
4. Check if the SD card is **fully inserted.**
5. That the SD card is formatted to **FAT32.** _ExFAT is not compatible._
6. If the SD card still doesn't respond, insert it into your PC and see if your operating system recognizes it. _If it does, consider creating a backup of your files and **use a different SD card with your printer.**_



### "File incomplete. Continue anyway?"

Our printers can detect a corrupted file on the SD card. A prompt appears on the screen, asking whether you would like to continue printing. Please check our article on how to [test your G-codes before printing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/incomplete-file-testing-if-file-gcode-is-complete_2153).

---

# [LCD screen not working](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/lcd-screen-not-working_2098)

The LCD screen is vital for operating the printer. Should you encounter any kind of trouble, such as a dead screen, corrupted text, or other issues, please refer to the guide below.

First of all, unscrew the LCD screen from the printer frame, remove both M3x10 screw holding it the LCD board in the plastic casing, and remove it from the casing. See if the problem still appears when the LCD is not pressed by the casing.

### Squares or random signs on the LCD screen

Firmware updates are necessary to keep your printer up to date. However, the installation of incorrect firmware can lead to letter corruption on the LCD screen. There's an easy fix, though:

There is a small chance the printer's LCD screen can glitch out by electrostatic discharge when inserting the SD card. Try to turn the printer off and on again.

### Blank LCD screen

This problem usually appears only on user-assembled printers. If your printer's LCD screen remains blank or displays corrupted symbols after you turn on the printer, there is a chance it is caused by incorrect wiring. Follow these steps to fix the issue.

1. **Turn the printer off, remove the power cord and unplug the printer's USB cable from your PC**
2. Open the cover of the electronics board.
* Original Prusa i3 EINSY RAMBo board can be accessed by reverting [STEP 31](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-electronics-assembly_34416#35680) in the Electronics Assembly.
* Original Prusa i3 miniRAMBo board can be accessed by reverting [STEP 21](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-electronics-assembly_34416#35208) in the Electronics assembly.
3. Double-check that **all cables** are properly seated and they are not visibly damaged. Depending on the model of your printer, please refer to the following guides for information on how to make sure the cables are properly connected: [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107) and [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109).
4. Make sure that the LCD ribbon cables are not warped at any spot and that they are fully seated in the correct connector with the correct orientation.
5. If you suspect that the LCD ribbon cables connectors are not firmly seated in the slots, disconnect the LCD ribbon cables and check the slots for any bent pins. If there are bent pins, you can use tweezers to fix them. However, be **very careful** not to break the pin(s) completely.
6. Gently push the connectors back into their respective slots. Then reconnect the power cord and turn the printer on again.

7. If none of the above resolved the problem, **turn the printer off again** and try to unplug both of the cables, lay them down on a flat surface and gently stretch them. Then plug them back in and turn on the printer.

# [Crash detection](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/crash-detection_2100)

Trinamic drivers on the EINSY board can detect skipped steps and prevent layer shifting caused by a nozzle crash. **It works only in the Normal mode (not in the Stealth mode).** The thresholds for crash detection are set for higher speeds because layer shifting usually happens when the extruder moves quickly between objects and hits a piece of a curled-up print.

Crash detection doesn’t work if you push the extruder in the direction of its movement. That’s not a real-world scenario and it usually never happens during printing.

### How to fix it

When you find out that the crash detection does not work, it is most likely going to be a hardware problem within the printer, which is quite easy to fix. Simply follow these instructions:

### Power mode

Make sure that the printer is running in **Normal mode, not Stealth mode** where crash detection is not available **.** The current mode can be checked in the LCD Menu - Settings - Mode [Stealth/Normal]. For more information on Power modes, please see [Power-modes](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/power-modes_2213).

### Rods and bearings

Clean the smooth rods with a dry paper towel. Then apply a little bit of lubricant on the smooth rods.

If you feel the heatbed or the extruder is not moving smoothly when pushing it by hand, you can dismount the Y or X-axis, remove the bearings from their smooth rods, and lubricate them on the inside. Be careful not to damage the bearings when inserting the smooth rod back.

Please refer to

[this guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/maintenance-tips_23200)

for more information about how to apply the lubricant.

### Check the tension of your belts

Make sure that your printer's belts and pulleys are properly tightened and that the belts cannot jump over the pulleys. If you have an MK3 or MK3S, check the **Belt Status** numbers via _LCD menu - > Support -> Belt Status_. The values should not be under 240 and above 300, but there is no single ideal value. The number does not represent any quantity.

* If your value is **under** (or close to) 240, you need to **loosen** the belt
* If your value **over** (or close to) 300 -> you need to **tighten** the belt
* The values are updated every time you run the Selftest.



The MK2.5, MK2/S, and lower models do not have the belt status option. The clue we can give you is that the belt should sound roughly like a low bass string when plucked. It should be possible to pinch the two sides together with your thumb and index finger, but you should feel a little bit of resistance.

The belts can stretch and get more lose over time or during shipping (in the case of an assembled printer).

### Check your X/Y axis motors and pulleys

Make sure the pulleys are not spinning around the motor shaft. The X and Y motor have to be tightened in the motor mount, the **pulley** has to be secured on the motor shaft and aligned with the pulley on the opposite end, and the pulley has to move freely. **Both grub screws** need to be tight, one of them has to be tightened against the flat part of the motor shaft. A loose pulley is usually the main cause of staircase layer shifts.

Both pulleys on both axes also have to be **aligned** , meaning the motor pulley has to be well **centered**. The belt should not travel from right to left while the pulley is turning.

#### Connectors

After inspecting the motors, open the einsyRAMBO case and re-seat the connectors for the motors, so you are sure they are plugged in properly.

### Print geometry and settings

Objects with **overhangs** are generally harder to print. Some overhangs might even warp upwards during the print, and the nozzle might crash into them. The same can happen in some cases if you choose **too small infill percentage** when slicing the 3D model.

To prevent printing overhangs, you can cut the object (check out our article on the [Cut tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cut-tool_1779)). You can also try to increase the print fan speed or increase the Z-hop distance in PrusaSlicer. Print fan speed in _Filament settings - > Cooling_ and Z-hop distance in _Printer Settings - > Extruder 1._

### None of this solved the problem?

No worries, at least you have checked some of the most important parts of the printer, and you can now be sure they are OK. Please try to print one of the G-codes that were on the SD card when you first used it. If you have deleted them, download them again at [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/@Prusa3D/collections/3195).

You may also try to **toggle the Crash Detection off** (LCD Menu - Settings - Crash. det. [on/off] or, during the print LCD menu - Tune - Crash Detection). It also usually helps if you **slow down the print speed** (in the PrusaSlicer or during the print by turning the knob counterclockwise).

# [Printer does not turn on or keeps turning off](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/printer-does-not-turn-on-or-keeps-turning-off_2102)

If your printer doesn't turn on, keeps turning off, or is stuck in a boot loop, see here how to fix the issue.

### The printer is stuck in a boot loop

This can happen if you are trying to re-flash the printer firmware, or on rare occasions when trying to start a print. The solution for this issue is to turn off the printer on the **PSU button** and turn it on again (do not use the LCD reset button for this issue).

In case the issue is not fixed, make sure that all the cables are properly connected to the main board.

### The printer does not turn on

If your printer does not turn on at all, then there might be a more serious problem present. Try the following steps:

* **Turn the printer off and disconnect the power cord.**
* Check all the wiring for broken cables. In some cases, overtightening the zip-ties can damage the wire insulation and cause a short.
* Check the wiring of your RAMBo board. Make sure that the PSU cables are properly plugged in.
* Use the appropriate guide to check if any of the fuses in your printer are blown



###

### MK2S / MK2.5 / MK2.5S

If your printer happens to power off during the initial preheating process, there's usually no serious damage. Most likely you just have the voltage switch set to **220V** in a **110V** power environment.

1. **Turn the printer off and remove it from the power source.**
2. Find the AC voltage switch for 110v or 220v on the PSU.

3. Make sure that the rocker is switched to your **local voltage setting**.
4. Try to turn the printer on again.



Both the silver and black Delta PSU

**will automatically switch**

between 110V and 220V, depending on the grid it is connected to.

### Checking status-LED on the PSU

Every PSU has a green indicator LED to show whether it is active or not.

**The silver PSU** has this located inside its case, seen through the metal cover, in the bottom-left (purple arrow).

**The black Delta PSU** has this LED hidden behind the cover of its terminals. Remove the two screws on the cover (green circles) to reveal the terminals, for probing with a multi-meter, and the green indicator-LED (orange arrow). **
**

The power switch on the black Delta PSU does not have an LED.

# [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107)

With our Original Prusa i3 MK3, we have introduced a logic board called **Einsy RAMBo**. It works on 24V and uses Trinamic drivers for motors, allowing for super silent printing and much more.

### Electronics wiring

Organizing all the cables can be a bit challenging, so we recommend you take your time. If there are any issues with your printer's wiring, they will be most likely discovered by the [Selftest failed (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-failed-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2045) or when running the initial **Wizard.** For more information **about the cable management** , we recommend checking [Electronics assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-electronics-assembly_174100) of the assembly manual.

Note, that the filament sensor is called the **IR sensor** on the MK3S. The position of its cable is still the same.

**Did you know, that...?
** The RAMBo board is designed and built to sustain considerable heat. It does not need any cooling even if the printer is in an enclosure.

# [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109)

Written as Mini-RAMBo, Mini Rambo, or Rambo mini, the logic board used in the Original Prusa MK2 series is very simple.

Please refer to the image below regarding wire colors and correct connector orientation. If you are getting [Selftest errors](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-failed-mk2-s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2049), or if you are encountering any issues related to the electronics (motors not moving, wrong temperature readings), we suggest going once again through the detailed step-by-step guide in the manual chapter [8\. Electronics assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-electronics-assembly_94304).

**Did you know, that...?

# [Blown Fuse (MK2S/MK2.5/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2111)

The Original Prusa i3 MK2 series printer is equipped with fuses to protect the most important peripheries. If your printer or some of its components suddenly stopped working, it is recommended to check for blown fuses and replace them if necessary.

### miniRAMBo

The printer has a miniRAMBo logic board that has three removable fuses. The fuses we use are known as ATO blade fuses for automotive applications.

**Each fuse protects a different part of the miniRAMBO board:**

* **F1 (5A fuse) -** Extruder motor, X-axis motor, Y-axis motor, and both Z-axis motors
* **F2 (5A fuse) -** Extruder heating, fans, and logic unit.
* **F3 (15A fuse)** \- Bed heating



### Checking the miniRAMBo fuses

1. **Turn the printer off** and **disconnect the power cord.**
2. Open the miniRAMBo cover by removing the long M3x40 screw holding the Rambo-cover doors closed. Please refer to [Electronics assembly - Finalizing Rambo Cover](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-electronics-assembly_94304#95064) of the assembly manual for more details.
3. Now you have access to the miniRAMBo. **Pull the fuses out** and inspect them. The photos below show what the intact fuses look like. Inspect them from below and check if the little wire inside is not broken. In case you cannot tell if the fuse is broken, replace the fuse preventively.



If you own a multimeter, you can check the components for a potential short.

[Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117)

will show you how.

Your RAMBo board can be black/brown instead of green. The color does not matter.

### PSU fuse

The printers are equipped with an additional fuse in their PSUs. You can check the pictures below for how to find it.

When you are replacing the fuse, make sure that the printer is turned off and disconnected from the power source.

* **Find the PSU fuse** , which is located just above the PSU's power plug.
* **Remove the cover of the PSU fuse** , the best tool for that is the screwdriver that comes bundled with our printer.
* **Inspect if the wire inside of the fuse is intact.** If it is damaged, then it must be replaced.



### Replacing blown fuses

If you find out that any of the fuses are blown, you can easily replace them. The fuses can be found at any local car parts/hardware store or ordered online. It's a good practice to bring the blown fuse with you so that you can get the exact same one.

1. **Turn the printer off, disconnect the power** and remove the blown fuse(s) from their sockets.
2. Place the new fuse in the correct slot - **Double check that you are replacing 5A for 5A or 15A for 15A.**
3. **Unplug any components** connected to the previously blown fuse and try to turn on your printer. Check for any kind of unwanted behavior.
4. Once again, turn off the printer and remove the power cord. Then **reconnect all the disconnected components**.

---

# [Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117)

In many cases, we need to decide whether a component is faulty, or just wrongly installed. There are also situations where we need to decide exactly which component should be replaced. We are using the multimeter (multitester) for checking **the continuity of wires** , measuring **the resistance values of heaters and thermistors** , and measuring the **voltage coming from the PSU and going to the heaters**.

If you don't have a multimeter, you can consider one that is similar to what is depicted above. The device does not have to be expensive. 10-15 USD/EUR will get you something that does the job just fine.

### How to measure

To get started, we first have to properly connect the two measurement probe cables to the multimeter.

* The **black** lead goes into the **COM port**.
* The **red** lead goes into the port for **Volts (V)** , **Ohms (Ω),** and **Frequency (Hz)**.



**Then we have to set the correct voltage or resistance range** on the multimeter, depending on which component you are testing. _For example, you can not measure 100K Ohm (Kilo=1000) if your meter is set to only 200 Ohm. You must set ut to 200K._

_Reference for multimeter settings_

#### Resistance setting:

* **For all thermistors** , set the resistance **value to "200K" Ohm** (green arrow), since the thermistor should have around 100K.
* **For all heaters** , set the resistance **value to "200" Ohm** (green arrow), since heaters read between 1 and 20 Ohm.



#### Voltage setting:

If measuring the voltage going to a heater or to the printer itself it is important to remember that the **MK2/S and MK2.5S are 12V systems** , while the **MK3S is a 24V system.**

* **For a 12V system** , set the meter to **"20" volt** (red arrow).
* **For a 24V system** , set the meter to **"200" volt** (red arrow).



#### Continuity setting:

The setting is indicated by the purple arrow and **will display 0 and give a beep if the two probes connect** , either by touching or connected by a cable. This is to test if a wire is broken or not.

### Where to measure

For every component, there are several options, our main focus will be on the connectors. The measurement appears on the multimeter LCD as soon as the measurement probes touch the component. To obtain the correct and relevant values, this is where you need to apply the probes:

**Thermistors:** metal inserts in plastic connectors **Hot end/Heat bed heater:** screws holding the cables in the connector

* **Heat bed:** the solder pads/screws holding the wires on the heat bed or the ends connected to the mainboard (green square). **You must remove the cables from the board before you do the measurement!** _On MK2S/MK2.5S you can measure voltage and resistance on the screws holding the cables in the connector. Remove the connector from the board before measuring._



### Fuses or wires

Fuses can be checked by **using the continuity feature** on a multimeter. The only thing that will be checked is whether the component is able to conduct signals or power. By touching each of the measurement leads of the multimeter to the other end of the fuse or wire, a signal (beep or 0 value on the multimeter screen) will indicate that the component is intact and therefore, should work.

The fuse for the PSU can be taken out of the slot above the power cord by using a flat head screwdriver.

### Resistance

For this measurement, the printer has to be turned off, at room temperature and the component that is measured has to be **unplugged from the RAMBO!**

In order to check if heaters are within their range of specified resistance, the following measurements can be done. For this measurement, **the multimeter needs to be set to the lowest range which includes 20Ω.**

The measurement can be done on the screws in the connector for both the hot end heater and the heat bed. For the heat bed, it is also possible to probe the solder pads/screws holding down the cables. Please see the pictures above.

#### Heaters

The measurement of the resistance of the hot end heater and the heatbed with a multimeter is only indicative and may vary from the actual resistance by tens of percent depending on the temperature. The measured values should therefore only be taken as a guide in identifying the problem.

#### Thermistors

For this measurement, the printer has to be turned off, at room temperature and the component that is measured has to be **unplugged from the RAMBO!**

In order to check if thermistors are within their range of specified resistance, the following measurements can be done. For this measurement, the multimeter needs to be **set to the lowest range which includes 150 kΩ.** It is common this is 200K on multimeters.

**All thermistors are rated to be 100 kΩ at 25 °C.** To be realistic, with a varying temperature between 20°C and 30°C, **you can expect [80 kΩ - 125 kΩ].**

**Always check both thermistors to compare the two. Are they different, one is probably faulty.**

### Voltage

**For this measurement, the printer will be turned on and there will be a risk of shorting the circuit. Always make sure to keep + and - from touching each other!**

In order to check if the correct voltage is being supplied to the heaters, the following measurements can be done. For this measurement, the multimeter needs to be set to the lowest range which includes 24V.

The measurement can be done on the screws in the connector for both the hot end heater and the heat bed. For the heat bed, it is also possible to probe the solder pads/screws holding down the cables. **In this case, the connectors have to be connected to the RAMBO.**

To measure, start preheating the printer to PLA and measure the component you are investigating.

**The following values can be expected:**

If you suspect the PSU is dead, and you have checked the external fuse, you can probe the terminals directly. Remove the two screws holding the cover (yellow circles) and you will have access to the power terminals.

Be very careful when probing the contacts. Make sure you do not short-circuit any terminals.

VCC and ground (+ and -) are divided into two pairs, where the two left connectors are VCC (red arrows) and the two right connectors are ground (blue arrows). Measure one from each pair.

Measuring the DC output on brick PSUs, like supplied with the Original Prusa MINI, is not recommended. You can easily create a short circuit and damage yourself or the component.

# [Filament sensor MK3 (non-S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-sensor-mk3-non-s_2125)

The optical filament sensor detects the presence of a filament and also its movement. Make sure you are running [the latest firmware](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) since new versions offer a higher-frequency sensing algorithm and improved reliability.

### Running out of filament

Running out of filament **will no longer cause a print failure**. If you run out of filament, the printer will automatically pause the print, unload the remaining few centimeters of the material from the heatbreak, and move the X-carriage away from the print. You will be prompted to replace the spool and insert a new filament.

**The printer will guide you on how to resume printing safely:**

1. _"Please press the knob to unload the filament"_ = Press the knob to unload the remaining few centimeters of the filament.
2. _"Repeat unloading filament?_ **[]** = If everything went well, press **[Yes]**. If not, then press **[No].** The printer will lock the x-axis motor and will allow you to open the extruder idler to clear the remains of the filament manually.
1. To open the extruder idler, simply undo [STEP 16](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly-textile-sleeve_71288#78248=) in the E-axis assembly.
2. Then, you can use the bundled pliers to remove the filament remains. If some of it got stuck in the PTFE tube, simply push it out with a new filament.
3. Close the extruder idler as described in [STEP 16](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly-textile-sleeve_71288#78248=), and you will be able to continue.
3. _"Insert filament and press the knob"_ = Make sure to insert the same type of filament, cut the tip of the filament properly (check out the photo below for the reference), insert the filament and press the knob.

4. _"Changed correctly?"_ **[Yes/Filament not loaded/Color not clear]** = If everything went fine and the new filament is coming out nicely (and has the right color), simply press **[Yes]**. If you think that the filament was not loaded properly, press **[Filament not loaded],** which will push through the same amount of filament as before. If the color is not clear, then press **[Color not clear]** , this way it will push through only a bit of filament.



### False sensor readings and debugging

There is a couple of common causes for false sensor readings. You can avoid most of them by following these two rules:

* Keep the surroundings of the filament sensor clean
* Avoid "extreme" light conditions near the printer



#### Proper setup & Clean surroundings

1. Make sure that the filament sensor is inserted correctly and the connectors are firmly attached.

2. Make sure that there is no **dust on and around the sensor.** If you believe that there might be some, you can clean it using compressed air. There is a hole in the idler door precisely for this purpose.

3. When you print the printable parts yourself, make sure that the extruder parts are printed in **BLACK.** The filament sensor is calibrated to operate in a black-colored environment only. Otherwise, it might be giving false readings.



#### Extreme light conditions

If you’re printing in **extreme light conditions** (e.g., direct sunlight, extreme LED lighting) you might also encounter some false alarms. If that happens, please consider turning the filament sensor off for that specific print in **LCD Menu - Settings - Fil. sensor** [on/ **off].**

We would also strongly suggest finding a different placement of the printer or changing the surrounding lighting conditions

#### Exotic filaments

Some translucent filaments cast more light on the sensor than others, which can result in weird behavior. Certain colors like ivory, matte white, or lime green can also cause false alarms. If you’re printing with any of these filaments and you’re getting a lot of false alarms, **consider turning the sensor off** in **LCD Menu - Settings - Fil. sensor** [on/ **off** ].

# [MK3S keeps prompting filament change](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mk3s-keeps-prompting-filament-change_2129)

With the Original Prusa MK3S (and the Original Prusa MK2.5S upgrade), we are introducing a completely reworked extruder with a new filament sensing system. It is a **hybrid solution** , combining an **IR laser** sensor triggered by a tiny **mechanical lever**. This system is not influenced by the optical properties of the filament and is immune to mechanical wear.

### **What does it look like**

This guide is related to the situation when the **filament autoload is working** (or even if it would trigger only sometimes), yet the printer keeps asking you at the beginning of a print to unload the filament and then to load it back in, in other words, the printer keeps prompting filament change. This means that the filament sensor by itself is working, but not as it should.

In general, the Filament sensor is not vital for the printer, meaning you can always turn it off in the **LCD Menu - > Settings -> Fil. sensor** (toggle between **ON** and **OFF** ) and continue using the printer.

**Correct connection to the mainboard** \- It is not uncommon to connect the filament sensor incorrectly.

### Troubleshooting

There are multiple reasons why this behavior can appear. Please see [IR Filament Sensor Troubleshooting (MK2.5S, MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-troubleshooting-mk2-5s-mk3s_112226) for how to resolve your issue.

# [Thermal Runaway (i3 series)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/thermal-runaway-i3-series_2131)

**Thermal Runaway** is a safety feature designed to **cut power to the heaters in case of a thermistor malfunction.** If your printer's thermistor would somehow dislodge itself, electronic parts would get a lower (incorrect) temperature reading. In an attempt to compensate for the lower temperature, the heater could reach **dangerously high temperatures,** with the printer potentially becoming a fire hazard. Thermal Runaway prevents that from happening.

Make sure to distinguish between the **Thermal runaway** error and the **Bed thermal runaway** error:

* **Thermal runaway** \- indicates an issue with the temperature readout of the hotend.
* **Bed thermal runaway** \- indicates an issue with the temperature readout of the heatbed.



**Thermal Runaway** is configured to shut down the printer when the temperature drops by more than **15 °C** for more than **45 seconds.** If the temperature reading doesn't recover in the set time period, the printer will shut down and display the Thermal Runaway error.

### Thermal Runaway (hotend)

1. If you have recently re-assembled your hotend, make sure [everything is exactly as instructed](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbreak-heatsink-heaterblock-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_16104). An incorrectly assembled hotend can also cause this error.
2. Check the ambient temperature. The suggested ambient temperature is 16 °C or more. An unheated garage in winter might cause thermal runaway as the heater doesn't have enough power once the print cooling fan kicks in.
3. Visually check the thermistor if it is still securely and correctly installed in the heater block. _The whole cartridge should be inside the block, with no part of it sticking out._
4. Move the whole extruder left and right, at the full length of the X-axis, and wiggle the cable wrap behind it. _Check whether there are any fluctuations in the temperature readings. This would indicate an issue with the cable._
5. Check the thermistor cable connector on the [EinsyRAMBO](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107) or [miniRAMBo](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109). _Re-seat the connector so you know it is secure._
6. Check the fan shroud for any kind of damage. In some cases, users bent the shroud during assembly or when they were removing the printed object. A damaged or tilted shroud can change the airflow and start cooling the heater block directly. For safety reasons, the heater doesn't have enough power (by design) to compensate for that.



#### MK2.5/S consideration

Due to the cooling properties of the MK2.5/S extruder design and the Mk2.5/S being a 12-volt system, you **may need to run the print fan at only 70-80% when printing at PLA temperatures (190 - 215 °C).** Printing other higher temp materials, like **PETG and ASA, should need no changes to your slicer settings.**

#### E3D Silicone Sock

During the testing, we didn't find the E3D sock to be very beneficial, as it can fall off and cause print failures and even damage the printer. However, **if you are facing issues with Thermal Runaways on MK2.5/S and 70-80% fan flow is not sufficient for your application, this may be worth considering.** We do not provide this, but it can be [ordered from E3D directly](https://e3d-online.com/products/v6-silicone-socks-pack-of-3).

If you see a drop by 5 °C - 10 °C when the print fan is switched on (especially when the printer transitions from the 1st to the 2nd layer),

**it is normal.**

The nozzle temperature should recover rather quickly as the

[PID regulation](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pid-tuning_2265)

kicks in.

_Cartridge-type **hotend** thermistor used on MK2/S, MK2.5/S, MK3/S/+, and MINI/+._

### Bed thermal runaway

1. Check the ambient temperature. The suggested ambient temperature is 16 °C or higher. An unheated garage in winter might cause a bed thermal runaway error if the heater doesn't have enough power when the print cooling fan kicks in.
2. Keep the printer away from any unintentional sources of cooling. Positioning the printer near an air-conditioning unit or an open window might be the cause of unwanted temperature drops.
3. Make sure the bed thermistor is still secured underneath the golden Kapton tape.
4. Move the heatbed back and forth, at the full length of the Y-axis, and wiggle/move the cable wrap behind it. _Check whether there are any large fluctuations in the temperature readings (_ more than _15-20 °C). This would indicate an issue with the cable._
Check the thermistor cable connector on the [EinsyRAMBO](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107) or [miniRAMBo](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109). _Re-seat the connector so you know it is secure._
5. If you are printing small objects with PETG, try to multiple at once and/or place them away from the center of the heatbed.



_Glass bead **heatbed** thermistor used on MK2/S, MK2.5/S, MK3/S/+, and MINI/+._

### Damaged component

If the thermistor, or more likely its cable has been damaged it must be replaced completely. As the thermistor functions by the mainboard reading its resistance, this might change if soldered or spliced and is therefore not recommended.

# [MMU loading failed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu-loading-failed_2135)

If you see the error message “ _MMU load failed_ ” on the printer’s LCD display, it indicates that the filament **went through the Original Prusa MMU2S** unit (registered by the F.I.N.D.A. sensor), but it **didn't reach extruder Bondtech gears**. Sometimes, the filament reaches the Bondtech gears once but **not for the second time**. The MMU2S unit is trying to retract the filament once during the initial loading sequence to prevent possible issues during the print.

Any usage and troubleshooting of the MMU2S upgrade require the base printer (MK3S or MK2.5S) to be in perfect shape and working order and print without any problem when the filament is fed directly into the extruder.

### What does it look like

This is what you most likely see on the LCD screen:

You can also open the _LCD menu - > Support -> Sensor info_ and check the **_FINDA value_**. The F.I.N.D.A. sensor should be triggered, meaning the value should be 1.

The print is thus **paused** until the problem is resolved by user intervention followed by a successful load or unload of the given filament, after which the LCD displays the message " _MMU OK, resuming print_ ".

### How to fix it

For future reference, see the picture below and remember the name of each part of the MMU unit. You will find this information in your printed MMU handbook as well.

There are multiple causes for this to happen. Let's go through all of them, ranged by their probability.

### Filament spools

First of all, check the **filament spools**. Do they roll on the spool holders without any problem? The filament **should not be tangling,** neither on the spool nor in the space between the buffer and the spool holders.

### IR sensor is not triggering correctly

**Check that the IR sensor is working properly and calibrated correctly.** _Open LCD menu - > Support -> Sensor info_ and you will see the IR value. If the filament is not loaded, the value should be “0”. If the filament is loaded in between the Bondtech gears, you should see a steady “1”. Any flicker at any time will cause issues. Please see the article on how to perform the [IR filament sensor calibration (MMU2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-calibration-mmu2s_2245).

### Filament stuck in the PTFE tube

In most cases, it’s because of filament strings or the filament retracting with a thick end. The **shape of the filament tip** is very important for a successful MMU print. The tip should be pointy, but there must not be any **lump or string**. The diameter of the tip can be slightly bigger than the rest of the filament, but not too much.

To solve this in the short term, unscrew both Festo fittings of the long PTFE tube connecting the MMU2S and the printer's extruder. The filament string will probably stick out of the MMU2S unit. Pull approximately 20 cm of filament out of the unit and cut it (the MMU2S gears have likely damaged part of the string, so it’s better to remove it). Make sure the filament can go freely through the tube and that the tube is clean inside. Mount everything back and resume print. Check also the short PTFE tube that is inside the printer's hotend. If its mouth is deformed, replace it with a new one.

In general, if your filament comes out with a long string, it is because it unloaded at too high temperature. If it unloads with a blunt end, the temperature was too low.

#### Cooling moves

A good setting is to increase the number of "Cooling moves" in PrusaSlicer. This will move the filament back and forth in the cooling tube a set number of times before retraction, which can improve the tip of the Filament. The setting is found at the ' _Filament Settings_ ' tab, under _Advanced_ (picture below). Start by **increasing the number of cooling moves to 2-3.** More cooling moves will increase the print time.

#### F.I.N.D.A. sensor check

See if the FINDA sensor is correctly calibrated as described in [this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-setup-and-troubleshooting_2250). Always keep in mind the selector must be free of any leftover filament and dust. If you have issues with the selector not moving, see [MMU2S Selector not moving](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-selector-not-moving_1997).

#### Filament pulleys

It is very important that the five hobbed filament pulleys are aligned with the filament and secured on the flat side of the pulley motor's shaft.

#### Silent mode

Sometimes, switching the MMU2S into the Stealth mode can help. In this mode, the motors are running slower and thus the filament movement is slower. You can enable the Stealth mode in _LCD Menu - > Settings -> MMU Mode [] / [Stealth]._

### Idler-body tension screws and idler

#### Idler body tension screws

On the top of the MMU2S units is two tension screws, with springs, applying pressure to the filament upon load/unload. These should be slightly below the surface of the plastic part (about 1 millimeter).

#### Idler tightened on the motor shaft

First of all, make sure the motor on the left of the MMU unit (named Extruder or Idler motor) is seated correctly and in direct contact with the idler-body. The hole in the center of the idler barrel isn't entirely round, **there is a flat part that matches the shape of the motor shaft**. When the idler barrel is on the shaft, it has to be tightened by two M3x10 screws.

These screws must be tightened neither too much nor too little. If the screws were tightened too much, the plastic part will crack, in the opposite case, the idler will not be secure on the motor shaft.

Make sure there is **a small gap between the idler barrel and the idler-body.** These two parts must not be grinding on one another.

#### Rear PTFE holder too tight or too loose

Check the **5 long PTFE tubes** leading the filament up to the MMU unit. Make sure the _mmu2-rear-PTFE-holder_ is not tightened too much: manually push the filament back and forth through this section, it should be passing through without any resistance. It can also be too loose, in which case the PTFE tubes might accidentally snap out.

#### Individual filament length calibration

On the MMU2S upgrade, both filament sensors (FINDA and the IR sensor) are cooperating, so **there is no reason to do this** calibration anymore. The length of the filament is measured automatically thanks to the new IR filament sensor mechanism.

However, if you have **changed the length** of the Bowden PTFE tube between the extruder and the MMU2S unit, you can still do this calibration. Please refer to [this guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/service-menu-individual-filament-calibration_86376).

### Resuming print after repair

There are two ways to do that:

* Select _Resume print_ on the LCD. The printer will automatically preheat the nozzle, try to load filament and if it’s successful, it will continue.
* Press the **middle button** on the MMU2S and it will repeat the last unsuccessful operation, to test if the problem is resolved. **If the repair was successful, the LED will flash an alternating red and green.** Once you’re ready, press the Right button to resume the print.



If the issue was not resolved you will see the red LED still on and you will have to try to resolve the issue again.

---

# [MMU needs user attention](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu-needs-user-attention_2139)

**If your MMU2S print encounters an issue it will stop mid-print and one or more of the LEDs will be blinking red.** The following message will be displayed on the LCD: **“** _ **MMU needs user attention.**_ **”** followed by “ _Press the knob to resume nozzle temperature._ ” The print is paused until the problem is resolved.

### Green lights

As you would guess, the **green light means that everything works as it should.**

* **Stable green light (not flashing)** \- selector moved to the current position and ready.
* **Stable green light after loading** \- filament successfully loaded.
* **Rapid green flashing light** (after pressing the middle button) - The filament loading sequence is in progress.



This sequence won't stop until SuperFINDA senses the filament going through the selector or the user cancels the operation by pressing the middle button.

### Red lights

Based on the speed of the blinking, you can tell whether the filament got stuck during the loading or unloading phase.

* **Slow flashing** (~once every second) - a problem during filament **loading** (Filament sensor **did not trigger as expected** )
* **Fast flashing** (~4 times per second) - a problem during filament **unloading** (Filament sensor **remained triggered after the unloading procedure** )



_Reference for each part of the MMU unit._

### **Slow flashing Red**

An error occurred during the filament **loading process. This is most likely because the tip of the filament is too large.**

**Before anything else, try to simply press the middle control button to retry.**

In some cases, if the MMU is well-calibrated, it might just work. If that is not the case, you need to fix the tip of the filament using the procedure below.

1. Pull the filament out of the MMU unit by winding it on the spool to prevent tangling. _If you are unable to pull the filament out, loosen the[idler screws](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/3mQKqKUUYTLfaxL3.jpg) (the long screws with the spring on top). No need to remove them completely, just loosen them and remember how much they were tightened originally. **Once the filament is out, secure the idler screws at the same tension.**_
2. Take the tip of the filament, cut approximately 10 cm (4 ”), and create a sharp tip (as you usually do).
3. Insert the filament back into the PTFE tube behind the MMU2S unit. Make sure the filament is able to move freely inside.
4. **Press the middle button to test the loading sequence.**
5. Feed the filament in until the FINDA detects it and let the MMU retract it back to the "start position".
* If the LED switches to **red-green** flashing, **press the right button** to load the filament into the hotend and continue the print. (The hotend will re-heat first.)
* If the LED stays **red** , go back to step 1 and repeat the process. (If the selector moves to the right, move it back to the left by pushing the left button).



### **Rapid flashing red**

An error occurred during the filament **unloading process.** The SuperFINDA sensor is detecting filament after the unloading process has been completed.

#### Stuck in the selector

1. Remove the orange/white PTFE tube by unscrewing the silver-blue Festo fitting.
2. Pull approximately 20 cm (7.8 in) of filament out of the MMU2S selector, making sure there is no groove or dent ground by the hobbed pulley. _We need to get rid of the groove the pulley creates in the filament._
3. Cut approximately 10 cm (4 in) of the filament. **Create a sharp tip**.
4. Push the filament back into the MMU2S unit and let around 2-3 cm (1 in) of filament **stick out** of the selector.
5. Press the **middle button** and wait for the printer to move the filament back and forth. If it succeeds to do that, the LED of the concerned filament starts flashing **red and green**. If the procedure fails, it will stay red, in which case try to cut and load the filament again.
6. Finally, screw the Festo fitting back in and press the **right button** to continue the print.



#### Stuck in the extruder

1. Unscrew both ends of the Long PTFE tube.
2. Attempt to pull out the filament from the extruder. Use some force. If it is jammed, release the idler screw on the Printer's extruder and pull out the filament. Then tighten the Extruder idler screw again to the same tension.
3. Cut approximately 10 cm (4 in) of the filament. Create a sharp tip.
4. Push the filament back into the MMU2S unit and let around 2-3 cm (1 in) of filament stick out of the selector. If you have opened MMU, close it.
5. Press the middle button and wait for the printer to move the filament back and forth. If it succeeds to do that, the LED of the concerned filament starts flashing red and green. If the procedure fails, it will stay red, in which case try to cut and load the filament again.
6. Finally, screw the Festo fittings back in and press the right button to continue the print.



### **All red LEDs blinking**

In case all of the red LEDs are on and the printer reports that it needs your attention, **the problem is in the Selector or Idler position**. This often due to the SuperFINDA remaining triggered.

1. Make sure the filament is removed and that there is no filament in the selector.
2. Use an Allen key to press the Reset button next to the mini USB port, located on the right side of the MMU.
3. Wait until the printer resets the idler and the selector position.
4. Make sure the selector is in the right place and that the correct color is to be loaded.
5. Press the knob next to the printer's LCD screen to re-heat the nozzle and continue the print.



### All five red and green LEDs blinking

The MMu2S unit can detect if the stepper drivers are not able to provide enough power to the stepper motors.
Resetting the MMU2S using the reset button on the side of the unit is usually enough. However, if all the LEDs keep on flashing simultaneously, then it may be a power issue:

* Inspect the signal cable and MMU2S power cable for damages and check if they are properly connected to the MMU2S control board and to the printer's Einsy board.
* Try flashing the firmware of the MMU2S unit again, even if you are on the most current version.



### Check your calibrations, assembly and hardware!

There are several components and assemblies that must be put together correctly, and some even calibrated by you. Check out [MMU2S Setup and Inspection](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-setup-and-inspection_2233) for a complete run through of what you must make sure is correct before using your Original Prusa MMU2S.

# [Static memory has been overwritten](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/static-memory-has-been-overwritten_2145)

The printer shows the error message " **Static memory has been overwritten".** It is caused by too many commands in the memory at the same time, causing it to overflow. The firmware is then not able to fulfill any of the commands or may not boot up properly.

This error can appear in self- or community-built firmware versions. It usually does not appear in

[Prusa official firmware releases](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/downloads)

as these have already gone through our testing.

####

### How to avoid

Avoid requiring the printer to do several things at once unnecessarily.

#### Examples:

* When [calibrating](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_112351), let the calibration finish without loading a filament or inserting an SD card, unless prompted to.
* When loading a filament, wait until the filament is fully loaded and confirm the successful load with the toggle button before giving it further commands or inserting an SD card.



### How to fix if it persists

1. Do a full factory-reset where you clear "all data." Please see [Factory reset (MK2S/MK2.5S/MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mk2s-mk2-5s-mk3s_2216).



After the full factory reset just ignore the on-screen prompts for the Wizard and proceed with flashing the firmware.

2. Once you do so, re-flash the newest firmware. A guide on how to do this can be found at [How to update firmware (MK3S+/MK3S/MK3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk3s-mk3s-mk3_2227).
3. After this, calibrate and you should be able to operate your printer as usual.

---

# [Blackout occurred. Recover print?](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blackout-occurred-recover-print_2147)

The error message **Blackout occurred. Recover print?** appears if the power goes off for a longer period of time during printing, and the hotend and heatbed cool down. Therefore, the printer will wait for you to safely resume the print.

There is not much troubleshooting to do, so here's a couple of things you should check before resuming or canceling the print.

#### Troubleshooting

1. Make sure that all of the printed objects are still **attached to the steel sheet plate**.
2. Follow the instructions on the LCD screen and resume the print.
3. Stay with the printer for **10 minutes** and make sure that the print continues without any problems.
4. If you suspect that at least one of the printed objects is about to get loose, **it is usually better to restart the print**.

---

# [Please open idler and remove filament manually](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/please-open-idler-and-remove-filament-manually_2149)

The message on your LCD saying **Please open idler and remove filament manually** shows up when the extruder motor does not succeed to remove the filament from the hotend/extruder. Please do not panic, this can be solved very quickly and you do not need to abort the print.

If you get this error before a new print while you want to change the filament, first just try to

**load**

the filament again into the preheated hotend. The filament tip will melt again and it should be easier to remove it afterward. If that is unsuccessful, go through the following steps.

### Troubleshooting

---

# [Bed leveling failed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/bed-leveling-failed_2151)

The **Bed leveling failed** error appears when there is something wrong with the last stage of the calibration. This calibration is the last step of XYZ calibration and is performed before each print.

For

**MK2.5/MK2.5S printers that have the SuperPINDA**

installed, you

**MUST use firmware version 3.9.3, or above!**

There can be **three different error messages** related to the Bed leveling failed:

* Sensor didnt trigger. Debris on nozzle? Waiting for reset.
* Sensor triggered too high. Waiting for reset.
* Sensor disconnected or cable broken. Waiting for reset.



### Troubleshooting

#### "Sensor didn't trigger. Debris on nozzle? Waiting for reset"

1. Make sure the nozzle and heatbed are clear of any plastic.
2. Do the Z calibration through the **LCD Menu - Calibration - Calibrate Z,** which also levels the X-axis.
3. Try to resume the calibration or start the print again (depending on when the error occurred).
4. If you are still struggling with these error messages, it is recommended to go through the whole calibration again. You can follow this walkthrough [XYZ-calibration error-messages (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-error-messages-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_112340) or [XYZ Calibration error-messages (MK2/S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-error-messages-mk2-s_112407).



#### "Sensor triggered too high. Waiting for reset."

1. Make sure the hotend is fully inserted into the extruder.
2. Do the Z calibration through the **LCD Menu - Calibration - Calibrate Z,** which also levels the X-axis.
3. Try to resume the calibration or start the print again (depending on when the error occurred).
4. If you are still struggling with these error messages, it is recommended to go through the whole calibration again. You can follow this walkthrough [XYZ-calibration error-messages (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-error-messages-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_112340) or [XYZ Calibration error-messages (MK2/S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-error-messages-mk2-s_112407).



#### Sensor disconnected or cable broken. Waiting for reset.

1. Make sure that the P.I.N.D.A. sensor is properly plugged into the electronics board. You can double-check that using the [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107) or [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109) guides.
2. Visually check the PINDA sensor cable, look for any overtightened zip-ties which might be preventing the P.I.N.D.A. sensor to work properly.

# [Err: EXTR. FAN ERROR](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/err-extr-fan-error_2156)

The **EXTR. FAN ERROR** message appears when the extruder fan does not receive any RPM (Revolutions per Minute) readings, in other words, there is something preventing it from spinning. The extruder fan is the Noctua fan on the left of the extruder. If you have issues with the front print fan, please see [Print fan is not spinning](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/print-fan-is-not-spinning_2081).

### Troubleshooting

From the

_LCD menu - Support - Extruder Info,_

you can find the RPM reading of the 3-wire fans that support this.

**The expected range should be from ~3500 - 4200 RPM on both fans,**

when running at full speed. Only the print fan speed can be adjusted by the user.

1. Visually inspect the extruder fan and make sure there is no debris preventing it from spinning.
2. Bigger parts can be cleared with **tweezers** , dust can be cleared with a **computer cleaner spray** (hold the fan with your hand while blowing at it, otherwise, you might damage the blades).
3. If you have replaced one of the fans with a replacement not supporting RPM sensing, then you can turn off the monitoring in the **LCD Menu - Settings - Check fans.**
4. If the extruder fan stopped working completely, it must be replaced. You can purchase a new one at our [e-shop](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/mk3mk3s/199-hotend-fan-noctua.html) or contact the support for a [Warranty](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/warranty_2288) replacement.

# [Err: PRINT FAN ERROR](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/err-print-fan-error_2159)

**PRINT FAN ERROR** error message occurs when the print fan (the one at the front of the extruder) does not receive any RPM (Revolutions per Minute) readings. This can be caused by the fact that the fan does not spin, or by the signal (yellow) cable being interrupted.

### Troubleshooting

Visually inspect the print fan and make sure there is no debris or pieces of filament tangled in it, preventing it from spinning. Bigger parts can be cleared with **tweezers** , dust can be cleared with a **computer cleaner spray** (canned air).

Hold the fan vanes with your hand while blowing at it, otherwise, you might damage the motor.

#### Connector

#### Broken wire

If the error shows up even after cleaning the fan, see if it could be reproduced, by starting the fan from _Settings - > Temperature -> Fan speed -> 255_, and then moving the extruder manually along the X-axis, to the right and to the left multiple times.

**See if the fan at any time stops spinning**. Also, check the cables and wiggle with the extruder cable bundle a bit. The culprit is usually within the harness, near the extruder body.

If you have replaced one of the fans with a replacement part not supporting RPM sensing, then you can turn off the monitoring in the

**LCD Menu - Settings - Check fans.**

#### Check RPM

While the fan is turned on as instructed in the previous step, navigate to Support -> Extruder info. Check if the RPM reading for "Print fan" is around **3500 - 4200 RPM** , and does not change drastically when the extruder is moved. Exact RPM may vary, but any large change, or a zero-value, is an indication of a break in the wire.

# [Preheat error (Heatbed)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/preheat-error-heatbed_2161)

Preheat error can happen with either with your **Nozzle** or **Heated bed**. So 1st make sure with which of these you have the problem.

## "Heatbed preheat error" (Heatbed)

1. Make sure that your **Heated bed thermistor** is properly seated under the **Golden Kapton tape** (photo below)
2. Remove the cable cover from the back of the heated bed and inspect the leads to ensure they are still intact and soldered securely to the pads
3. For MK2/MK25: Make sure the heatbed connector is fully seated into the socket on the RamboMini - **You should routinely check this in general!**
4. If you've checked all the above and everything is in order. [Please flash to the latest firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk3s-mk3s-mk3_2227).
5. Would the issue still persist, then there is for sure something wrong with your heater or thermistor. In order to find out which one of these is malfunctioning. Do the simple test described below.



### How to find out if your Heater or Thermistor is defective for your Nozzle/ Heatbed?

It is not very common, but there is a chance that extensive printing damaged your heater or thermistor.

The easiest solution is to take a hairdryer and blow **hot air** at the Hotend or Heatbed. During this process just check if there is **any temperature change on the LCD.** If there is a change, it means that your thermistor is working, which means that **the heater is damaged**. If there is **no change** at all, your thermistor is defective.

### Checking voltages and resistance

Using a multimeter would be the most efficient and accurate way of determining if the components are good or not. It is quite straight forward. See [Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117) for how and what to measure.

---

# [Preheat error](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/preheat-error_2163)

The **Preheat error** message occurs when there is a problem with the preheat process before your print starts. Therefore, there is something preventing the printer from heating up in proper time.

Make sure to distinguish between the **Preheat** error and the **Bed preheat** error.

* **Preheat error** \- a problem with preheating the hotend.
* **Bed preheat error** \- a problem with preheating the heatbed.



### Troubleshooting

#### Preheat error

1. Make sure that the **ambient temperature is stable** and there is **nothing cooling the printer down** , such as a nearby air-conditioning unit or an open window.
2. Make sure the thermistor and heater are **properly plugged into the electronics board.** You can doublecheck that by following these guides: [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109) or [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107).
3. Check if the [fuses](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_1925) are not blown.
4. Make sure that your [hotend assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbreak-heatsink-heaterblock-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_16104) is correct.
5. If the issue persists, then there is something wrong with your printer's thermistor or heater. In order to find out which one of these two is malfunctioning, perform the simple test described below.



#### Bed preheat error

1. Make sure that the **ambient temperature is stable** and there is **cooling down the printer,** such as a nearby air-conditioning unit or an open window.
2. Make sure the heatbed thermistor is **properly seated** under the heated bed and secured with the **golden Kapton tape.** If not, then simply put it back and make sure that the thermistor cable has some space for movement.
3. Make sure that the thermistor and heatbed are correctly plugged into the electronics board. You can doublecheck that by following these guides: [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109) or [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107).
4. Check if the [fuses](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_1925) are not blown.
5. If the issue persists, there is something wrong with your printer's thermistor or heater. In order to find out which one of these two is malfunctioning, perform the simple test described below.



### Testing the thermistor and heater

You can also verify if the thermistor or heater are damaged using a

[multimeter](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117)

It is not very common, but there is a chance that only the thermistor is defective. You can check it using the following test:

1. Use a hairdryer to blow **hot air** at the heatbed or hotend.
2. In the meantime, check if there is **any temperature change on the LCD screen.**
3. If there is a positive **temperature change** it means that the heatbed or hotend thermistor is working. Which means there is something wrong with the heater or heatbed. In both cases contact our support and they will provide assistance.
4. If there is **no change at all** , the hotend or heatbed thermistor is defective.

# [MAXTEMP](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/maxtemp_2167)

The **MAXTEMP** error occurs when at least one of the temperature readouts of the hotend is higher than 305 °C. It is a safety feature that prevents the printer from overheating uncontrollably.
The **MAXTEMP BED** relates to the heatbed and appears when the heated bed reaches above 125°C.

### Troubleshooting

1. **[A damaged thermistor cable](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117) **may trigger the MAXTEMP error. Look for any overtightened zip-ties around the cables leading to the electronics board.
2. If the printer heats up uncontrollably when first powered up after the assembly, and the MAXTEMP error is triggered, **turn off the printer immediately and double-check your electronics assembly!** Please refer to the following guides:[Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109) or [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107).
3. **An occasional glitch** \- sometimes the heater can be tricked into overcompensating by a sudden blast of colder air. If this occurs, the heater can spike over the recommended temperature and trigger the error. Simply start the process again and **monitor the printer just to make sure that everything goes well.
** 4\. Inspect the G-code file or Slicer settings for incorrect temperature values.

---

# [MINTEMP error and MINTEMP BED](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mintemp-error-and-mintemp-bed_2169)

The **MINTEMP** error (written sometimes as min temp) occurs when the temperature readout from the heatbed thermistor or hotend thermistor **drops below a certain amount within a certain time frame**. It is a **safety feature** that prevents the printer from overheating in case of a faulty thermistor because, by default, the printer is set to balance out any heat loss by pumping more power into the heat bed or hotend heater cartridge.

**WARNING:** The temperature limits triggering the MINTEMP were set after rigorous testing. Adjusting them is **NOT RECOMMENDED** and might lead to damage to the printer and a possible fire hazard!

### MK2/S & MK2.5/S

Due to the hardware design of the MiniRAMBo and accounting for manufacturing tolerances, there is a temperature below which the thermistors are unable to read reliable values:

* Hotend thermistor - temperatures below 22 °C (71.6 °F)
* Heatbed thermistor - temperatures below 15 °C (59 °F)



For safety reasons, the MINTEMP error is triggered in case the measured temperatures are below these limits. This is for the firmware to accurately detect a damaged or disconnected thermistor. For a technical explanation of this limitation, please [see this Github issue](https://github.com/johnnyr/Mini-Rambo/issues/8#issue-401415524).

### MK3 & MK3S & MK3S+

The EinsyRambo board of the MK3/S/+ was allowed by its improved thermistor circuitry design to have a wider range of scale when it comes to temperature (thermistor) readings. It also has [an onboard thermistor for ambient temperature](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ambient-temperature-check-mk3-mk3s_161230). This has allowed the firmware to allow for a lower temperature threshold than on the previous generation (MiniRAMBo).

* Hotend thermistor - temperatures below 10 °C (50 °F)
* Heatbed thermistor - temperatures below 10 °C (50 °F)



Also, printing in very cold environments, outside of the recommended operational temperature, can have negative effects due to other factors than the printer's electronics, like material properties.

A completely disconnected heatbed/hotend thermistor will give the reading 0°C on the MK3/S/+

### What does it look like?

When one of the thermistor cables is broken, it can be observed when the temperature on the LCD screen starts randomly jumping up and down during the Y-axis or X-axis movement.

It is important to distinguish between the **MINTEMP** error and the **MINTEMP BED** error.

**MINTEMP -** problem with the **hotend** temperature readout.

**MINTEMP BED -** problem with the **heatbed** temperature readout.

This error can be caused by a simple glitch or a gust of breeze. The LCD displays "MINTEMP fixed" and you just need to restart the printer by pressing the X button, under the knob. **However** , if reoccurring, it indicates an intermittent break in the thermistor wire.

### MINTEMP HOTEND/BED fixed

If the cable regains a proper connection and a correct reading from the thermistor, the printer will update the error to "MINTEMP fixed" or "MINTEMP fixed", followed by "Please restart". **This does not mean the issue is permanently resolved**. You should continue the troubleshooting described in this article.

###

### Testing the thermistor

You can also test it with **a multimeter** (our article [Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117) can guide you). If it fails to read the resistance on the metal inserts in the jumper connectors, then the wire is broken. At room temperature, it should have a resistance you can expect resistance of 80 kΩ - 125 kΩ.

#### RAMBo board connector

That the RAMBo is the cause is highly unlikely, as the board would not pass the final testing that we do in our factory. However, try switching the Hotend and Heatbed thermistors on the board (both have 3 pins), if the MINTEMP does not turn into MINTEMP BED or if the MINTEMP BED does not turn into MINTEMP, the electronics board connector is broken and a new board is needed. You should also notice the temperature reading on the LCD change.

To find the thermistor see [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109) or [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107), depending on your printer.

### Wiggle it!

If you do not have a multimeter, a good way to test the cable of the thermistor is to simply wiggle it. Pre-heat to PLA (215/60) and move the extruder or bed by hand, all the way to the end of each side. See if there is any great change in temperature-reading on the LCD (tens of degrees or zeroing out).

Grab the textile sleeve and manipulate and wiggle it, again checking if there is any change in temperature. If there is, it indicates a microfracture of the cable when the connection changes depending on orientation. You then need to replace the thermistor.

### How to fix it

**For pre-assembled printer owners:**

If you happen to receive the printer during winter and you want to start using it out of the box, wait until it reaches room temperature.

#### Temperature

Make sure the temperature of the room where you operate the printer is **not below 20 ° C** (happens easily if you keep the printer in a basement during winter). Also make sure the printer is not placed next to an **opened window** , **air conditioning,** or in a way of a **breeze** that might cause a sudden temperature fluctuation.

If the issue is only caused by the ambient temperature of the room, **you can use a hairdryer on the bed / hotend until it reaches a temperature above 18C to initiate a print.** However, some materials, like ASA / ABS, may misbehave if printed in a cold ambient temperature without an enclosure.

#### Glitch

As mentioned above, the error might have been triggered by a **simple glitch.** Try to reset your printer by pressing the X button under the knob and see if it will print afterward.

### Thermistor connection

Check if the thermistor is **properly connected** to the RAMBo board: there is a latch on the connector that needs to **snap in place**. To find the thermistor see [Mini RAMBo electronics wiring (MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mini-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2109) or [Einsy RAMBo electronics wiring (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107), depending on your printer. Also, make sure the textile sleeve protection of the extruder cable bundle did not snap and that it is still protecting the cables, especially around the spot where they enter the electronics casing.

#### Hotend thermistor

At the other end of the hotend thermistor cable, inspect the wire where it goes into the heater block. This point is fragile and can get damaged.

#### Heat bed thermistor

As for the heat bed thermistor cable, make sure it is firmly attached to the underside of the heated bed with the golden Kapton tape. If not, try to press it back on. Make sure that the thermistor cable has some slack, as shown in the right picture below. It is also important that it is not being pinched by the printed cable cover when put together. This is so it won't be worn down by the movement of the bed.

### Replacement

In case there is visible damage on the cable, or if it behaves erratically, the thermistor must be replaced. You can follow our guides [How to replace a heatbed thermistor (MK3S+/MK3S/MK2.5S/MK2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbed-thermistor-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mk2s_19272) or [How to replace a hotend thermistor (MK2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-thermistor-mk2s_22208).

# [Preheat the nozzle!](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/preheat-the-nozzle_2172)

The error message **Preheat the nozzle!** occurs when you are loading new filament and the nozzle did not reach the needed temperature to do so.

The minimum temperature for loading a new filament is 190°C. However, it is recommended to select the actual recommended printing temperature of the material you want to load in.

###  Troubleshooting

1. Make sure the nozzle is preheated. The indication of the current temperature is visible on the main LCD screen.
2. You can preheat the nozzle in **LCD Menu - Preheat - select material or** it can be done manually through **LCD Menu - Settings - Temperatures.**
3. Wait until the required temperature is met, then you can put the new filament inside the extruder opening.
4. After that, you can load the filament through **LCD Menu - Load filament**.

# [Printer has not been calibrated yet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/printer-has-not-been-calibrated-yet_2174)

The error message **Printer has not been calibrated yet** occurs after the assembly of your printer or after the Factory reset of all data. It will remain on the main LCD screen until you successfully calibrate the printer.

#### Troubleshooting

1. Make sure you successfully finish the calibration. **If the calibration is interrupted** , with an error message or by the user, **no calibration data is saved**.
2. You can perform the whole calibration process through our **Wizard**. Simply go to the **LCD Menu - > Calibration -> Wizard**, or you can go step by step doing the Selftest, XYZ calibration, and First layer calibration, individually.
3. Once the calibration is finished, this error message will disappear and you will be able to safely use your printer.

# [How to prepare .stl files and G-codes for Multi Material upgrade](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-prepare-stl-files-and-g-codes-for-multi-material-upgrade_2176)

Preparing **.stl files** and **G-codes** which are supposed to be printed in one material is a rather easy process. This process became quite tricky once we must cope with up to 5 materials. For this reason, we have prepared easy to follow step by step manuals.

### Preparing .stl files

Under normal circumstances, you would create or download .stl file and simply transform it into G-code. With Multimaterial upgrade, there is one extra step.

Why is it more difficult than before? Well, the answer to this question is rather easy. In order to print up to 5 different filament colors, we will have to prepare 5 separate .stl files or split an .stl file to 5 parts so each of the parts can be printer with a different color.

If you have an .stl file with single part object in it and you want to print certain parts of the model with different color, try one of our [Splitting STL using MeshMixer](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/splitting-stl-using-meshmixer_106112). or [Splitting STL with single compact part](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/splitting-stl-with-single-compact-part_106640) guides.

# [Vibration when printing (MK3S+/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/vibration-when-printing-mk3s-mk2-5s_2177)

Your Original Prusa MK3S+/MK3S/MK3 printer may be causing some vibrations during use. In most cases, this will not cause any printing issues, however, we will show you how to minimize it or get rid of it entirely.

Changing the Power mode can often result in more silent printing.

### Identify the noise

Go to the _Printer display - > Settings -> Move Axis_, and _Move X_ and _Move Y_ individually to see if the noise can be narrowed down to a single axis. During operation/noise, try placing your hand on various components and hear if it dampens the sound.

Some sounds can be hard to identify and some may only present themselves with certain simultaneous movements. Therefore, we recommend inspecting all points outlined in this article, even if you are not sure exactly where the noise is coming from.

### Inspect your printer

#### Rubber feet

The printer comes with 4 rubber feet (green arrows) that should be placed in the correct position, 2-3 cm from the end of each extrusion.

#### Lubricating rods and bearings

New noises coming from the printer after many hours of use is likely a sign that the rods and bearings could use some attention. For more information on how and with what to lubricate check out our [maintenance guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/i3-printer-regular-maintenance_2072).

#### Align Y-rods

The Y-axis smooth rod alignment is [part of the assembly manual](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2b-y-axis-assembly_165795#167110) and can greatly improve cases of sound and vibration.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Losen all M3x10 screws on the four Y-holders half a turn (green arrows), so the printed parts are able to move (blue arrows).
2. By hand, move the heatbed back and forth across the entire length of the axis to align them.
3. Move the heatbed to the front plate and tighten all four screws of the front Y-rod-holders.
4. Move the heatbed to the rear plate and tighten all four screws of the rear Y-rod-holders.



####

#### Heatbed screws

Check the 9 screws on the heatbed if any might be loose. If these are not well secured, the heatbed, screws, and spacers can rattle during movements. When tightening, always follow the correct order of:

1. The center screw (light blue circles)
2. The four edges (purple circles)
3. The remaining four corners (yellow circles)



#### X and Y-axis pulleys

If the pulleys on the X and Y-axis are pushed against the motors, even just slightly, it adds resistance which leads to vibrations and even printing issues. Ensure that the spacing is correct (yellow arrow) and the pulley is oriented correctly.

Also, make sure the belt of the X-axis is aligned and not rubbing against a plastic part (purple arrow).

_X-axis motor with pulley installed._ _Y-axis motor with pulley installed._

#### LCD-display

Loose screws securing the LCD module and the LCD assembly, can lead to vibrations as the Y-axis is moving. Make sure the screws securing the LCD assembly are tight (green arrow). The LCD module can also rattle during operation if not tightened all the way (blue arrows).

#### PSU

The PSU is secured with 4 screws: Two M4 screws on the side through the frame (yellow arrows) and two M3 screws at the bottom into T-nuts in the alu. extrusion (green arrows). Make sure all 4 of these are secure.

### Other tips and tricks

#### Surface the printer stands on

The surface that the printer is on can amplify any of the vibrations and noises coming from the printer. **The surface the printer is on should be steady and firm, and should not wobble during printing or if pushed by hand.** A hardwood table is an example of this.

This can be enhanced further by placing the printer on a concrete slab/tile which would eliminate any vibrations traveling into the table/desk the printer is standing on.

#### Padding under the printer

An easy solution to dampening the noise and vibration of your printer is to add some sort of additional padding underneath the printer. This will dampen any sound resulting from the resonance between the
printer and the surface the printer is resting on.

Due to the different construction of the Original Prusa MINI,

**very soft padding is not optimal**

as the printer can wobble during operation.

You can use something you have around the house. Such as a folded towel or foam padding like you may find in children's play areas.

# [Where can you get 3D models?](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/where-can-you-get-3d-models_2179)

The best way to get started with 3D printing is to find pre-made models on the internet - they should be in the **.stl, .obj or .3mf** format to be used with PrusaSlicer. Fortunately, 3D printing has fans all over the world, and there are some great websites, where you can download a large variety of awesome 3D models.

3D models are generally free to download under the **Creative Commons - Attribution - Non Commercial licenses,** which means models are not to be used commercially. Otherwise, you must always credit the author. In some cases, you can download the models for a small fee and support the authors.

### Printables.com

We have released our own platform, [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/). There you can download both object files and pre-made GCODE files, for thousands of projects.

The [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/) platform is also built around the community, and using [the 'Groups' feature](https://www.printables.com/group/discover) you will be able to find likeminded people in your area, create cooperations and connections with other makers.

### Other platforms

There are plenty of platforms out there to pick from, but here is a list we have found helpful, in no particular order. Some of these platforms have both free and paid models, depending on your budget or need.

### Preparing downloaded models for printing

Before you can start printing them, you need to convert them into .gcode files first, [using a slicer](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/category/prusaslicer_204). We recommend PrusaSlicer, as it is powerful, open-source, and contains built-in presets and configurations for all Original Prusa 3D printers and a few others.

Once downloading other people's models becomes a little dull, you can start creating your very own models. A great start to 3D modeling is our article

# [PrusaPrint (Rpi Zero and Octoprint)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusaprint-rpi-zero-and-octoprint_2180)

**Raspberry Pi Zero W**

has no 5GHz Wi-Fi (only 2.4GHz), and a somewhat weak processor. It

**does not support using a large amount of Octoprint-plugins or streaming of video and is not officially recommended by the OctoPrint project.**

Use more powerful models like the 3B+ or the latest RPI 4 to take full advantage of Octoprint. However, they do need to be connected by USB, plus they need a separate PSU, which results in a less clean setup.

In this article, we will outline the preparations and configurations necessary to outfit your MK3S with Octoprint using a **Raspberry Pi Zero**. Here we will go through how to solder the correct GPIO pins and connecting the Raspberry Pi to the printer.

**PRUSAPRINT (PRUSA'S CUSTOM OCTOPRINT IMAGE) IS NOW OUTDATED AND NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED!**

This solution has been superseded by

**PrusaLink**

and

**Prusa Connect**

.

If you wish to use Octoprint, we recommend following the guide to

[creating your own Octoprint image](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/octoprint-configuration-and-install_2182)

.

You can run Octoprint from most versions of the Raspberry Pi (Zero, 2, 3, 3B, etc.), but [this is covered in a different article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/octoprint-configuration-and-install_2182). We have chosen the Raspberry Pi Zero W for this tutorial, as it integrates neatly with the MK3s Einsy RAMBo with no need for an external power supply.

This guide is not covering any other fruit alternatives, like Banana Pi, Orange Pi, etc.

Distinguish between models **Pi Zero W and Pi Zero**. The letter **"W"** stands for **Wireless**. **Buying a cheaper Pi Zero without WiFi will not work with this guide!**

### Parts and preparations

To complete this guide you need the following components:

* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* 2x20-pin Strip Dual Male Header, with 18 mm pins.
* Micro SD card of at least 8GB (16 GB is recommended).
* [Printed RPi Zero Frame](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36118-raspberry-pi-zero-frame-for-einsy-rambo).



To create a connection between RPi Zero W and EINSY board you need a GPIO header which you solder to the RPi board. You need a break-away 2x20-pin Strip Dual Male Header, **the version with 18 mm pins.** These types of headers come in different versions, but **the crucial part is that they are 18 mm long**.

_2x20-pin Strip Dual Male Header_

Now that you have your Pi and the pins, they need to be installed to the Einsy Rambo. To ensure the correct position of pins and optimal distance, our developers created a printed part, the RPi Zero Frame, which is placed between RPi Zero and EINSY board. This is also used as a template when soldering the pins, ensuring they go where they should.

_RPi Zero Frame_

RPi Zero Frame can be

[downloaded here](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36118-raspberry-pi-zero-frame-for-einsy-rambo)

.

_Recommended settings for print are profile 0.2 SPEED and material PETG or ABS._

The RPi Zero Frame is not fully compatible with the RPi Zero 2 layout. Be careful if using it or seek out a remix.

### Soldering the GPIO pins

Certain parts of this guide require the usage of soldering and cutting tools.

**Please read carefully the instructions for such devices/tools and use personal protective equipment.**

Prusa Research does not assume responsibility, and expressly disclaim liability for loss, injuries, or damage.

Prepare a piece of the GPIO-header, as in the illustration above, by simply breaking off the length you need and pulling out the pins you do not need with some pliers (right picture).

We are connecting this header to the UART pins (5V, GND, TXD, RXD) for serial communication, and to GPIO22 as mechanical support.

Sandwich the printed frame, the RPi Zero, and the GPIO pins together like is shown in the right picture below, Make sure the tips of the GPIO pins stick out about 1 mm, from the correct holes. You are now ready to solder the pins.

When soldering, you need the solder to "flow", creating a proper bond between the pins and the pads on the RPi Zero. If you end up with balls and blobs you need to reflow it for a proper bond. The solder needs to be clinging to the pins and the pads. You want "cones" as in the pictures above and below. Most solder will also turn shiny if done correctly. If you have no experience soldering we recommend looking up some videos on the basics.

### Installation of SD card

The RPi Zero W hardware is now ready to be installed to the Rambo case, but for the lack of access once installed, you first need to prepare the SD-card which runs its operating system.

**PRUSAPRINT (PRUSA'S CUSTOM OCTOPRINT IMAGE) IS NOW OUTDATED AND NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED!**

This solution has been superseded by

**PrusaLink**

and

**Prusa Connect**

. If you wish to use Octoprint, we recommend following the guide to

[creating your own Octoprint image](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/octoprint-configuration-and-install_2182)

.

### Connecting the RPi Zero to your printer

1. Make sure the printer is turned off and carefully cut all the indicated plastic parts and remove the cut-out part. During the cutting process, **MAKE SURE YOU DON'T CUT the Einsy board!!!**



On the MK3 (non S) there might not be this prepared area to cut. You can still cut it out, but this is a bit scary and you won't have the protective cover. We recommend printing the latest version of the Rambo-case.

2. Slot the RPi Zero, with its frame, into the connector holes indicated below (green square). Then fit the cover to protect the RPi Zero W (purple arrows).



3. Make sure the RPi Zero is properly installed by inspecting the connector on the other side of the Einsy Rambo (green arrows). Notice that the position of the support pin is in the corner (purple arrow).



### Checking if the RPi works

Go to the printer's _LCD menu - > Settings -> RPi port_, and make sure it is set to ON. Return to the printer's home screen. Now, wait for a few minutes. The RPi Zero is not a superfast computer and it needs time to boot.

Then open the browser and try opening a website: _octopi.local._ If _octopi.local_ doesn't work, please use the following steps: Check your router for a new IP address, using an app like Fing, or wait until the address is displayed on the printer's display.

As soon as you have the IP, open a web browser on your PC, type it in, and hit Enter. If the Octoprint webpage loads, you can continue.

### Troubleshooting

OctoPrint provided by Prusa Research is tested and is confirmed to be booting correctly. If you can't access the web interface, check the following:

* Is the RPi port enabled on your printer?
* Did you enter the correct Wi-Fi name (SSID) and password?
* Is the RPi Zero W correctly plugged in the EINSY RAMBo board?
* Are you connected to the same Wi-Fi network?

# [Octoprint - Configuration and install](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/octoprint-configuration-and-install_2182)

This article covers how to configure your own image for any Raspberry Pi (RPi) from scratch. Following this article, you will have connected a base installation of Octoprint which you can expand upon. It will also include how to configure the Raspberry Pi Zero to be connected by its GPIO pins. However, the Raspberry Pi Zero is not powerful enough to utilize advanced Octoprint features and plugins, like video streaming, and is officially not recommended by the Octoprint project.

**This article will cover:**

### Required parts

* A Raspberry Pi A, A+, B, B+, 2B, 3A+, 3B, 3B+, 4B 1/2/4GB, or Zero W/2 + PSU.
* WiFi dongle if your RasPi does not have built-in WiFi.
* USB Cable:
* **Original Prusa i3:** USB type-A cable.
* **Original Prusa MINI:** Micro USB cable.
* An SD or microSD card for your RasPi of at least 8GB.
* Computer with a working SSH client, like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/). _Mac/osX and Linux have SSH integrated into their Terminal._
* A (micro)SD card-reader to flash your SD-card.
* WiFi network.



### Flashing the Octoprint image

Since the Raspberry Pi Foundation released their "Raspberry Pi Imager", it is no longer necessary to edit config files after flashing. All can be configured in the imager, within its Advanced options menu. Raspberry Pi Imager even allows you to download images through it. Let's go through it.

1. Download and install the Raspberry Pi Imager for your computer. This is [found here.](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)


2. Click the 'CHOOSE OS' button and navigate to ‘Other specific purpose OS’ -> ‘OctoPi’ -> ‘stable’ version.


3. Enter the Advanced Options by pressing Shift \+ Ctrl \+ X. Enable SSH to set a hostname (name of the RPi on the network) and main password right away, as well as your WiFi network and password to connect to the Raspberry Pi later.


4. After this, select your SD card under 'CHOOSE STORAGE', before clicking 'WRITE' to start the flashing process.



### Connecting the RasPI

**Insert the (micro)SD card into your RPi and connect it to the printer by USB. After this, power your RPi.** The Raspberry Pi Zero W will be connected to the printer using its GPIO pins, not USB. We recommend doing this before proceeding. _However, for these configurations, you can power it using a 5V phone charger and connect it later._

If you use RPi Zero over GPIO, RPi port should be 'On'. However, it also requires further configuration outlined

[later in this article.](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/octoprint-configuration-and-install_2182#configure-rpi-zero-w-gpio)

**When using USB to connect to the printer, deactivate the RPi port** ( _LCD menu - > Settings -> RPi Port_ and set it to "Off").

All Raspberry Pis can be connected by USB. The exception is the RPi Zero, which can also be connected by its GPIO pins to the MK3S' Einsy Rambo. If you intend to use the RPi Zero, you can still follow this guide to the end, where GPIO configuration is covered. **Connecting the RPi Zero by USB or any other RPi by GPIO is possible, but has few if any, benefits.**

_MK3s/MK2.5S USB Type-B USB port_ _MINI Micro USB port_

### Finding the IP

The RPi will need a few minutes on its first boot before it will connect to your network. You should then be able to find the RPi IP address in a mobile app like "Fing" or a similar IP scanner. The IP address will have the same prefix as your computer, but with a different ending. It probably also be Named "Octoprint" and/or "Raspberry Pi" or a variation of this. _Common local IP addresses are 10.0.0.XXX or 192.168.0.XXX._

### Launching and configuring Octoprint

Open your browser and type in either "octopi.local" or the IP address of the RPi. You may be greeted with a welcome wizard. Please go through it and add a printer profile. Then we need to configure the Printer profile.

Click the Settings-wrench in the top right (purple arrow). Here you can configure your profile, install plugins, and other settings (green square).

Select "Printer profiles" and click the pen icon (purple square) to edit. Under "Print bed & Build volume", change the values in the table below. **All other values can be left to default.** _This will only affect Octoprint's control over your printer, and will not affect sliced G-codes._

Form FactorOriginHeated BedWidthDepthHeightCustom Bounding Box
MK3SRectangularLower leftYes250mm210mm210mmX: 0/250, Y: -4/210, Z: 0/210
MINIRectangularLower leftYes180mm180mm180mmX: 0/180, Y: -3/180, Z: 0/180

**If you are using Octoprint with the Original Prusa MMU2S/MMU3** you will also have to set "Number of extruders" to 5, and tick the checkbox for "Shared nozzle".

For RPis connected by USB, you can leave 'Serial Port' and 'Baudrate' on "AUTO" (blue square), and click the Connect button. Congratulations! You are now ready to use Octoprint with your printer. _Octoprint will ask if you wish to update. Do so now, before installing any plugins._

### Installing plugins

Running Raspberry Pi on your printer is sometimes called having a headless system, as there is no screen directly connected to the Pi board. Whenever you move your printer to a different network (and have edited _octopi-wpa-supplicant.txt_ for the new network) or forget the printer's IP address, there is a plugin that will show the IP address on the printer's screen.

IpOnConnect may not work with the Original Prusa MINI.

Open your OctoPrint's web interface. Open Settings and in the left column find "Plugin manager", Scroll down click on "Get More..." (purple arrow) and search for "IPonConnect". Click install. After installation, a pop-up will prompt you to Refresh the page. Click "Refresh".

**Turn the printer off and on again** by flipping the switch on the side. Give it a few minutes and you should see the IP address on the display. _Note that if you enter the printer's menu or insert an SD card, the IP address can disappear from the screen and you have to reboot the printer to see it again._

**A lot of Plugins are not recommended when running Octoprint from an RPi Zero** , due to its weak processor. Video streaming is one such function.

### Use

As we do not develop Octoprint, we can not cover all aspects of use. For that, we suggest checking out [Octoprint's own resources](https://octoprint.org/). However, we recommend checking out our guide covering:

Below is a list of Octoprint plugins you might find useful or cool:

* Simple Emergency Stop - Button on UI to stop everything immediately.
* NavBar Temp - Temperature is shown in the navigation bar.
* Heater Timeout - Shuts off heaters after set duration when idle.
* OctoLapse - Better timelapse
* Themeify - Cool (mostly dark) themes for the UI.



### Configure RPi Zero W GPIO

**To use RPi Zero/2 W connected directly to an MK3/S+ GPIO,** you must change a setting in the printer's menu and configure how the Pi handles serial communication. By default, OctoPrint does not use the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins for Serial-communication. You configure this by connecting to it over SSH. **This part only applies to the Raspberry Pi Zero/2 connected by GPIO directly to the MK3S Einsy mainboard.**

### Printer setting

First, to use the GPIO pins for connecting to the printer, activate the RPi port ( _LCD menu - > Settings -> RPi port_ and set it to "On").

### Using SSH

The Octoprint image which you flashed should have SSH (Secure SHell) enabled. SSH is a way to have remote command over a device after inputting a hostname (what you called the RPi) and password. Make sure the RPi and your computer are connected to the same network and use the credentials below.

#### On Windows:

Open [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) and input "hostname@your_IP_address" ( _Example '[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)'_) to the Host Name field (green square). _Most users can leave 'Port' number to 22._ Make sure _'Connection type'_ is "SSH" and click Open (purple arrow).

#### On Mac:

An SSH client is built into Terminal. Open Terminal and type the following:


ssh hostname@your_pi_address

In the console, you will be asked for a password. Input your password. _No characters will appear as you type._ Hit enter and you will have shell-command over your RPi.

#### On Linux:

Most popular distros also have an SSH Client installed and you connect the same way as on Mac. However, for all edits except changing the super-user password of the RPi, you can locate and edit the files using a card reader, from your desktop environment. _Built-in card readers may not work on virtual machines. Use a USB card reader._

**The first time you connect to the RPi by SSH** , you may get a security warning that a "Server host key is not in cache". Make sure the IP you are connecting to is correct and accept proceeding with the connection by clicking Yes.

In the console, you will be asked for a password. Input your password. _No characters will appear as you type._ Hit enter and you will have shell-command over your RPi.

Using the command

_sudo raspi-config_

in the Terminal brings you a tool to change WiFi network and password, as well as the main password of the Pi.

#### Swapping ports used by GPIO and Bluetooth

Two config files must be updated and a serial port added, over SSH. Some of the following codes are taken from a thread in our forum (Shout out to Scott.w12:).

The first thing to enable serial connection is to swap ports used by the GPIO (soldered pins) and the internal Bluetooth chip. We need to add a line in the config file on the boot partition.


sudo nano /boot/config.txt

With the down-key, move the cursor to the very end and add:


dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt

Press Ctrl+X to exit the Nano text editor. Press "Y" to save and hit enter to confirm the file name.

If you experience connection or read/write issues, add the following line to the same file.

For good measure you can also disable Bluetooth services globally with the following Terminal commands:


sudo systemctl disable hciuart.service


sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service

#### Disabling the serial console

Moving to another config file, where part of the code must be deleted to disable the serial console.


sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

Look for the following string (text) and delete it.


console=serial0,115200

#### Rebooting RPi

For all changes to take effect, enter the following command to reboot the RPi.

#### Adding a serial port to Octoprint

The last part of the configuration is in the web interface. Open your browser and type either "octopi.local" or the IP address of the RPi Zero W. You might be greeted with the welcome wizard, please go through it first.

As soon as you arrive at the home screen, open "Settings" by clicking the wrench. Then head to "Serial Connection", and insert the line below to "Additional serial ports" (green square).


/dev/ttyAMA0

Save the change and reboot OctoPrint. After reboot, select the new port (purple arrow) and connect to your printer (blue box). Also, tick "Save connection settings" and "Auto-connect on server startup" for your convenience.

The Raspi Zero is not a powerful device! It may be advisable to now remove pre-installed plugins, like "G-Code analyzer", to improve performance and reduce CPU usage.

# [MMU2S LEDs meaning](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-leds-meaning_2187)

As you can see, there are five main LEDs on the MMU2 unit. Their arrangement corresponds to the arrangement of the 5 PTFE tubes and 5 filament channels. Each LED consists of two sub LEDs: **Red** status LED **Green** status LED.

### **Green light**

As you would guess, the green light means that everything works as it should.

* **Stable green light (not flashing)** \- selector moved to the current position and ready.
* **Stable green light after loading** \- filament successfully loaded.
* **Rapid green flashing light (after pressing the middle button)** \- The filament loading sequence.



This sequence won't stop until FINDA senses the filament flowing through or the user cancels the operation pressing the middle button.

### **Red light**

As for the red light, its meaning also depends on the context:

#### **Stable red light (not flashing)**

Wait until the printer finishes the current activity (there is not necessarily a problem).

#### **Slow flashing during print**

An error occurred during the filament **load.**

1. Pull the problematic filament out from the PTFE tube and cut the end to create a sharp tip
2. Insert the filament back into the white PTFE tube
3. Press the middle button to start the loading sequence
4. Push the filament until it’s caught by the drive gear
5. If the LED turns red and green, press the right button for 1-2 seconds to continue the print
6. If the LED turns red, repeat the process.



#### **Rapid flashing during print**

An error occurred during filament **unload.**

1. Remove the orange/white PTFE tube by unscrewing the silver fittings from MMU2 body
2. Check whether there’s a filament string stuck in the MMU2’s selector
3. Pull the filament out from the orange/white PTFE tube:
* If you’re unable to remove the filament from the tube, proceed to the other end of the tube
* Release the Festo fitting on the extruder and if needed open the extruder idler
* Then pull the filament out from the extruder body
4. Using your fingers move the filament back in the MMU unit and leave about 1 cm sticking out.
5. If the filament is stuck inside the selector and you’re unable to move it, press the left button - this will start load/unload:
* If the printer failed at the loading stage the button works in loading mode
* If the printer failed at the unloading stage, the button is in unloading mode
* The middle button will be used now. Press it once and wait for the printer to finish the auto-check procedure.
6. If the procedure finishes correctly, the LED above the affected filament will turn to red-green flashing, if the procedure fails it will remain red.
7. To continue after fixing the issue, press the right button.



#### **All five LEDs blinking red after power on**

If the filament is present in the selector during power-up, it’s detected by the FINDA and the standard booting move sequence is interrupted, as it would bend or break the filament. Remove the filament manually first so the boot can continue. No need to press any button. As soon as you take the filament out, the printer will continue by itself.

1. Try to pull the problematic filament out from the back.
2. If you’re unable to pull the filament out, try powering the printer off and try again.
3. You can unscrew the FESTO coupling from the MMU2 selector and instead pull the filament out from this side. If you’re able to pull the filament out in this direction, cut it near the spot where the filament enters the white PTFE tube.
4. As a last resort, remove the selector motor by unscrewing the 3 screws holding it and push the smooth rods out with an Allen key. You can then easily remove any debris stuck in the selector.



#### **All five red and green LEDs blinking**

Resetting the MMU2S using the reset button on the side of the unit is usually enough. However, if all the LEDs keep on flashing simultaneously, then it may be a power issue:

* Inspect the signal cable and MMU2S power cable for damages and check if they are properly connected to the MMU2S control board and to the printer's Einsy board.
* Verify the proper connection of the [filament sensor to the Einsy board.](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-troubleshooting-mk2-5s-mk3s_112226)
* Try flashing the firmware of the MMU2S unit again, even if you are on the most current version.

# [Different nozzle types](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/different-nozzle-types_2193)

Our Original Prusa MK2/2.5/3/S/+ printers come equipped with a standard E3D V6 0.4mm brass nozzle, while our Original Prusa MINI/+ come equipped with a standard V6-compatible nozzle.

Our Original Prusa MK4 and Original Prusa XL come with a quick-swap brass Prusa Nozzle. On these models, it is possible to fit our Nextruder-to-V6 nozzle adapter, to make it compatible with V6 nozzles. However, there is **a whole ecosystem of nozzles** with different characteristics on the market.

### E3D V6 brass nozzle, Prusa Nozzle brass

Brass has excellent heat conductivity and is tough enough to print most "everyday" filaments. It is also accessible and reasonable to manufacture, which is probably why many 3D printers are supplied with brass nozzles.

Besides the standard 0.4 mm diameter, **we provide configurations for 0.25 mm, 0.6 mm, and 0.** **8 nozzle diameters.** On top of that, you can always create and customize your own profiles. To achieve fine detail, you can use a 0.25 mm nozzle. We recommend using it only for very small objects, a few centimeters in size, as the print times are **considerably longer** compared to 0.4mm nozzles. By contrast, if you want to speed up the print and the details are not as important, you can try using the 0.6 or 0.8 mm nozzle.

### Identify nozzle size

#### E3D V6 nozzles

**On E3D V6 nozzles and Prusa Nozzles, you can identify the nozzle diameter by the dots around the rim of the nozzle.** For example, the E3D 0.4 mm nozzles shipped with the Original Prusa MK3S+ have three dots (blue arrows).

Note that the E3D V6 0.25 mm nozzle has no dots, and looks almost the same as the E3D compatible 0.4 mm nozzle that ships with the Original Prusa MINI/+.

_Markings apply to all E3D V6 nozzle types (brass, hardened, X)._

_Markings apply to Prusa Nozzles_

#### PrusaSlicer configuration

To adjust preset settings in **PrusaSlicer,** go to _Configuration - > Configuration Wizard_ and select the printer model you have as well as the nozzle diameter you are currently using (purple squares).

Unclick all the other models and nozzle diameters to avoid confusing the presets. You can always do the Wizard again and modify the settings. To set a different nozzle size on your printer, please see

[HW setup (MK2.5/S & MK3/S/+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hw-setup-mk2-5-s-mk3-s-_1943)

.

On MINI/+, MK4, XL, navigate to

_Menu - > Settings -> Hardware_

.

Except for the presets for the stock 0.4 nozzle, all other nozzle configurations will have the diameter **stated in the name** of the profile. If you don't have the words "0.25 nozzle", "0.6 nozzle" or "0.8 nozzle" in the profile's name (green square), the preset is for a 0.4 mm nozzle.

### Prusa Nozzle ObXidian

The ObXidian Nozzle is a high-quality nozzle designed specifically for abrasive materials and for printing at high temperatures. It is made from hardened steel with a corrosion-resistant coating, ensuring exceptional durability and longevity.

These nozzles are particularly suitable for printing with abrasive materials like carbon fiber, as they maintain their hardness even at higher temperatures, delivering excellent performance and extending the lifespan of your nozzle.

### Hardened steel nozzle by E3D

E3D, a UK-based company, that supplies hotends for the Original Prusa i3 printers, has a whole ecosystem of upgrades and add-ons. We support some of them, including the hardened steel nozzle.

Hardened steel nozzles are a must for **highly abrasive materials.** A regular brass nozzle will degrade very quickly and lose its properties when printing these. _You should note that a hardened steel nozzle is not the same as a stainless steel nozzle._

Most of the abrasive materials are composites, plastics with additives. Some examples are [ColorFabb XT CF20](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/20-carbon-fiber-xt-cf20-filament-750g/), [ColorFabb Bronzefill](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/bronzefill-filament-750g-2/), [ColorFabb SteelFill](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/steelfill-filament-750g-2/), and some glow-in-the-dark filaments. Always ask your filament vendor if you are not sure about filament requirements. A slight disadvantage of the hardened steel nozzle is that some standard materials like ABS cannot be printed as fast as with a regular nozzle. Due to the different thermal properties of a hardened steel nozzle compared to a brass nozzle, **you may have to increase the nozzle temperature when printing.**

**For multi-material printing using the Original Prusa MMU2S**

, we only provide presets for a

**0.25 mm, 0.4 mm, or 0.6 mm brass nozzle.**

Other types of nozzles, i.e. hardened steel or other exotic alloys, may cause issues.

### Nozzle X by E3D

Nozzle X is a nozzle designed to address the thermal limitations of a hardened steel nozzle and the poor abrasion resistance of plated copper or brass nozzles. It is coated with WS2, a poly-phobic coating, that reduces the amount of plastic that sticks to the inside of the nozzle. For this reason, **Nozzle X should not be maintained the same way as hardened steel or copper nozzles.**

It can be used with abrasive fillers like glass, kevlar, or carbon reinforcement, but does not support more abrasive fillers, like Boron Carbide, Boron, Boron Nitride, Tungsten, or Tungsten carbide.

**Recommended cleaning methods:**

* Non-abrasive cloth/rag for external use.
* Cleaning filament for internal use.



**Non-recommended cleaning methods:**

* An acupuncture needle or a brass brush can damage the coating.
* Cold-pulls. Can tear off the WS2 coating.



### The Olsson Ruby nozzle

Similar to the hardened steel nozzle, [The Olsson Ruby](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/the-olsson-ruby/) is designed to print highly abrasive materials. Since it is mostly made of brass, it retains the excellent heat conductivity and throughput of the stock brass nozzle, but with a very hard gemstone as its tip. Even though the ruby gemstone is highly wear-resistant, it’s also brittle. If you have the _Live Z adjust_ value set incorrectly, or if your PINDA sensor is not set to a correct distance and the nozzle hits the removable steel sheet, the nozzle may crack. **For installation, please refer to the[official 3DVERKSTAN instructions](https://support.3dverkstan.se/article/66-the-olsson-ruby-instructions-for-use), as its installation is a bit more involved.**

### Other nozzle diameters

If you want to use a nozzle with a different diameter than the ones we already mentioned, you have to create the profile in PrusaSlicer manually. Starting with your standard 0.4 mm nozzle, you have to change the nozzle diameter in the Printer Settings and Extrusion width (percentage-wise). Keep in mind that the maximal layer height is always around 80% of the nozzle diameter. For more information, please see [Creating profiles for different nozzles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/creating-profiles-for-different-nozzles_127540).

**A 0.1 mm nozzle can be considered experimental;**

Its small diameter will not work with all filaments, the tolerances required in its manufacturing are hard to guarantee and the excessive printing time it requires can be beyond reasonable. For these fine resolutions, you may want to consider

[SLA printing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/types-of-printers-and-their-differences_112464#sla)

.

### First Layer Calibration of other nozzles

Starting from firmware **3.13.0** , the [First Layer calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364) works for multiple nozzle sizes. The nozzle size can be changed at _Settings - > HW setup -> Nozzle d. __[0.25|0.40|0.60|0.80]_. The 0.4 mm nozzle is the default.

You can easily create a rectangle in PrusaSlicer by right-clicking on an empty build plate and select '

_Add Shape - > Box_

'. Then scale it to be 0.2-0.4 mm tall, depending on the nozzle you are calibrating for. You want a box that is only one layer thick.

#### Reset Live Adjust Z value:

* **Original Prusa MK3S+/MK3S/MK2.5S** \- Reset your Live Adjust Z value from _LCD menu - > Settings -> Live Adjust Z_, then scroll the selector knob clockwise until the value reaches zero.
* **Original Prusa MINI** \- Reset your Live Adjust Z value from _LCD menu - > Calibration -> Live Adjust Z_, then scroll the selector knob clockwise until the value reaches zero.
* **Original Prusa MK4, XL** \- These models are equipped with a Loadcell. If any Live Adjust Z value is set, this is automatically reset after the next print is done.



#### After this, start your G-code and 'Adjust Live Z' while printing:

1. Press the knob after it has started extruding and locate 'Adjust Live Z'.
2. Select it and turn the knob clockwise until the line is flattened, but not squished. _It should have a smooth top. When doing solid top-fill, make sure there are neither gaps between the lines (too far away), nor ridges between the lines (too close)._ Please see [First Layer Calibration (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364) or [First Layer Calibration (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-mini-mini_229122) for examples.
3. Press the selector knob again to store the value.



_The image depicts the first layer of a 0.4 mm nozzle. The line can be almost half the width of what is depicted._

### Other considerations

#### Smaller diameters (~0.25 mm)

Almost any [Composite material](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/composite-materials-with-metal-or-wood-particles_166863) is out of the question. The particles in it can (and will) quickly clog or ruin your nozzle. However, filaments with fine glitter or similar "shine particles", like what is found in [Prusament Galaxy Silver](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-pla-galaxy-silver-1kg/), should be no problem.

[Flexible materials](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flexible-materials_2057) can also be problematic on a smaller diameter nozzle due to the higher pressure required for extrusion. It can buckle and tangle around the filament pulleys with higher pressure.

Higher temperature filaments like ASA and PC Blend have a rather high melt-flow rate and will print well with a 0.25 mm nozzle.

**However, it can not have composite particles like kevlar, carbon fiber, or glass.**

**Slow speed** \- Precision takes time, **prepare yourself for printing times of 24 to 100 hours** , even with smaller objects. Not only is each line thinner and narrower than usual, which results in more perimeters, but the extruder movements are also greatly reduced to accommodate the increased accuracy.

When printing with a smaller nozzle, calibration and bed leveling become even more important. After changing the nozzle, make sure you at least run the Z calibration of your printer before you start printing.

Besides the First layer calibration, additional calibration is not necessary on the Original Prusa MINI.

#### Larger diameters (>0.6 mm)

The main drawback is its resolution. The thicker and taller layer lines will print the object faster but will have limitations in regards to fine details. On the other side, functional parts may prove stronger since each line has a larger amount of solid material.

Also, thanks to the larger nozzle diameter there will be more solid material to cool down which may increase warping. This might be an issue for materials prone to warping during print, like ABS or PC Blend.

To avoid

# [Flexible steel sheets (guidepost)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flexible-steel-sheets-guidepost_2195)

The Original Prusa magnetic heatbed is designed to hold a removable double-sided flexible spring-steel sheet, designed specifically for easy removal of printed objects from the print surface.

**We offer 3 different types of sheets** , with different strengths and attributes. The first sheet released was with a **Smooth PEI sticker on both sides**. Second, after using it for several years in our own print farm, we solved reliable manufacturing of the **powder-coated textured sheet** , aimed at production environments using PETG and other high-adhesion filaments. The latest addition is **the Satin sheet** , which in both texture and properties lies between the smooth and the textured sheet. For more information on each sheet, please see their respective articles linked below.

### **General information**

The removable spring steel sheet is held in place by a number of magnets glued to the heatbed, from the bottom side. On the top of the heatbed, there are two pins (left picture) that align perfectly with a notch in the spring steel sheet (right picture). _Before putting the steel sheet on the heatbed, make sure the heatbed is clean and free of any filament debris._

Please ignore the two holes in the steel sheet that are on the opposite side of the notch. Those are from the manufacturing process and are not for aligning the sheet on the bed.

### Steel sheet profiles

Each sheet needs a different Live-Z value, as they have slightly different thicknesses. If you are using multiple different sheets, the value for each sheet can be stored in the Steel sheet profiles. For more information see the article [Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955).

### Removing prints

To remove the printed object from the print surface, always wait until the steel sheet **cools down to room temperature.** Then you can take it off by **bending the sheet** inwards and outwards, but you may have to assist using a spatula to avoid damage to the sheet. **For materials like PETG, ASA, ABS, and PC Blend, and/or prints with a large first layer surface, a separation layer in the form of gluestick may be required.**

In case you are still having trouble removing the model even after letting it cool down or the surface got damaged during the removal (a piece of the surface was ripped off or cracked), you might be using a filament type that is not suitable for being printed on this kind of print sheet or the surface was not prepared correctly. Please see our [Material table](https://help.prusa3d.com/materials) for filament and print sheet compatibility and surface preparation.

If you are using a spatula to help with the model removal, make sure to avoid damage to the sheet surface. Bend the sheet slightly and insert the spatula under the model whenever possible, instead of digging under the model on a flat surface.

For a stubborn print that refuses to be released from the print surface, you can try to re-heat the heatbed for a few minutes (to the original print temperature) and then let it cool down again. This can sometimes help with the removal of the prints that are too stuck to the print surface.

Consumable parts, such as print sheets (satin, smooth, textured, etc.) are not covered by warranty as the coatings will diminish over time. Unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship, cosmetic damage, including but not limited to scratches, dents, cracks, or another cosmetic damage is also not covered by the warranty. Only defective sheets on arrival are covered by warranty.

### Differences between the sheets

It is possible to use all sheets for printing almost any type of material if cleaned properly and the first layer (Live Z) is set correctly. However, there are certain benefits to using one sheet or the other for certain materials and models.

_Close-up of a printed object on the_

#### Smooth PEI sheet

Both sides of this sheet are covered by a sticker made from smoothed PEI plastic. This is the same time-tested surface type that was used on the older MK2S printers. Prints with a small area touching the print surface or with sharp corners are less likely to detach when printing on a smooth spring steel sheet. Some users also like the smooth and shiny bottom side of their prints. **For all details and considerations of the Smooth sheet, please see[Smooth Steel Sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/smooth-steel-sheet_196550).**

#### Powder-coated textured sheet

The surface of this sheet is covered with a special polymer (Ultem) to ensure perfect adhesion. The powder-coated steel sheets are better for printing objects with materials such as PETG, CPE, or Flexfill (TPU) which tend to adhere too much to a smooth surface, but can be more easily removed from the textured one. **For all details and considerations of the Textured sheet, please see[Textured steel sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/textured-steel-sheet_196534).**

#### Satin sheet

The Satin sheet further expands our line-up of print sheets. Its powder-coated surface with a lightly textured matte finish offers an optimal level of adhesion and is fully compatible with a wide range of common and less-common filaments. **For all details and considerations of the Satin sheet, please see[Satin steel sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/satin-steel-sheet_196526).**

### Filaments

We have done a lot of testing and compiled our results for you to use. To easily see how to prepare your sheet for any filament type, please [**see our Material table**](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials).

_*Values in this screenshot may not be up to date._

### Prints don’t stick

If your print surface is perfectly clean and all grease has been removed by wiping it with a paper towel soaked in isopropyl alcohol 90% and if the first layer height is set up perfectly, yet your print still does not adhere reliably to the print surface, check out [First layer issues](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804).

# [Corrupted 3D models for printing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/corrupted-3d-models-for-printing_2205)

You’d be surprised how many 3D models you can find on the internet are broken in some way. Modern slicers are pretty good at repairing the models without you even noticing. However, not all of the corrupted 3D models can be repaired automatically. Therefore, we would like to give you some tips on how to repair these.

### Repair using PrusaSlicer

PrusaSlicer will automatically repair models to a certain degree, but it may be necessary to fix the model using a dedicated service. If you are using **PrusaSlicer under Windows 10** , it will have access to Microsoft's APIs for repairing 3D models through Netfabb.

You can either right-click on the warning symbol found by the name of the model in question (left picture green arrow) or right-click on the model itself and select "Fix by the Netfabb" (right picture red square).

There are several ways to repair a 3D model. You’ll find that sometimes one solution works and another doesn’t, depending on the specific model. We’ll only focus on solutions that are **free** and **easy to use** :

# [Live Z adjust not saving](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/live-z-adjust-not-saving_2207)

The Live Z Adjust is a tool that is used for easy corrections of the 1st three layers of your prints. In this article, we will look at the most common problem associated with it, which is when the value is not storing.

### Live Z adjust not saving

Most likely this problem is occurring due to the fact that you have skipped a step in the calibration flow. The printer would then display:

_"Distance between the tip of the nozzle and the bed surface has not been set yet. Please follow the manual, chapter First steps, section First layer calibration."_

Unless you finish the calibration process. Your printer will not be able to store its Live Z data. Therefore please make sure that calibration flow was followed precisely and finished entirely.

Steps to follow once your printer has been assembled:

1. Run "Self Test"
2. Run Calibrate XYZ
3. **FW version 3.1.0. and newer:** simply go to the **LCD - Calibration - First layer cal.** and launch the 1st layer calibration from there.
4. **For FW versions till 3.0.12:** Print "[V2Calibration.gcode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prusa3d/Prusa3D-Sample-Objects/master/MK2/V2Calibration.gcode)" **!Needs to be finished at least once - after that, you can make additional changes during the start of your prints.!**
1. If you do not run the "V2Calibration.gcode" the Live Z Adjust value will not be stored.
2. If you purchased a fully assembled printer and having similar issues, it's best to run through the same steps as above for the kit version.
3. If the above does not solve the issue, please follow the instructions for a [full factory reset](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mk2s-mk2-5s-mk3s_2216) and re-run the above steps.

# [Creating your own 3D models](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/creating-your-own-3d-models_2209)

Creating a brand new 3D model from scratch can be a little daunting if you have no prior experience. However, at some point, you will probably run out of [pre-made 3D models to download and print](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/where-can-you-get-3d-models_2179) or not find exactly what you need. Time to give 3D modeling a go.

There are various ways of getting into 3D modeling. You will, obviously, need a 3D modeling software and learn the basics. Rest assured that there are less complicated and free options for modeling 3D instead, instead of jumping right into the deep end of CAD design other top-tier commercial solutions.

For inspiration, check out

[Prusaprinters.org](https://www.prusaprinters.org/)

, our very own universe of 3D models made by our awesome community!

### Modeling programs for beginners

**TinkerCad** (<https://www.tinkercad.com>): The easiest way to quickly create your own models. TinkerCad is an online editor (no installation required) allowing you to create 3D models directly in a browser window. It is free, easy to operate, and you will even find basic video tutorials. So after a few minutes of tinkering, you will be ready to create your first 3D object.

**Fusion 360** (<https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview>): Another popular tool for creating models. Fusion 360 is available for PC, Mac, and iOS (iPad). It is arguably more complex than Tinkercad; however, the official website provides a quick guide along with detailed video tutorials, making it also an excellent choice for novice enthusiasts.

### Other modeling programs

There is a great deal of 3D modeling programs out there, both free and paid. Your choice depends mostly on your personal taste and preferences. If you feel like TinkerCad and Fusion 360 lack some features or functions, you should research the following software:

* OpenSCAD (free)
* DesignSpark Mechanical
* SketchUp
* Blender (free)
* Maya
* 3DS Max
* FreeCAD (free)

# [Print statistics](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/print-statistics_2211)

The printer tracks printing statistics. When you access this option during a print, you will see statistics for the running print. If you do so while the printer is idle, you will see the total statistics. Both filament usage and print time are tracked.

You can find this menu in the LCD Menu -> Statistics. The data can be easily reset once you do a [Factory reset (MK2S/MK2.5S/MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mk2s-mk2-5s-mk3s_2216).

# [Power-modes](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/power-modes_2213)

Prusa printers are well known for being very silent, even in the standard mode. But actually, our printers also offer an option for even quieter operation. In the instructions below you will learn how to set your printer to stealth mode.

### MINI and MINI+

The MINI/MINI+ is equipped with the TMC2209 motor drivers, where after multiple tests **we have enabled StealthChop (Stealth mode) by default for X, Y, and Z-axis.** The name Stealth mode comes from the MK3/S/+ and basically enables the same settings on its TMC drivers (StealthChop).

On the MINI+, **the only exception is the extruder motor**. Mainly due to the Bowden tube between the extruder and print head, it performs better and more reliably with the SpreadCycle enabled (that's the other mode of the TMC motor drivers).

### MK3 and MK3S

#### Normal vs. Stealth mode

MK3 series printers offer two print modes. **Normal mode** is required for the detection of lost steps (shifted layers), while still being quieter than the silent mode on MK2/S. There is also the **Stealth mode,** which utilizes Trinamic StealthChop technology. This makes the printer almost inaudible where the print cooling fan is the noisiest part of the printer.

**Stealth mode**

does not provide Crash detection (lost steps cannot be detected).

**These modes can be switched depending on the situation:**

1. When idle:

_LCD Menu - > Settings -> [Normal / Stealth mode]_

2. During a print:

_LCD Menu - > Tune -> [Normal / Stealth mode]_




### MK2/S, MK2.5 and MK2.5S

#### Power vs. Silent mode

**The silent mode** uses less current and makes the printer quieter but less powerful. **Hi-power mode** is great for very large (over 200 gram) prints. It is also recommended for newly assembled kits before you fine-tune everything. If you experience lost steps (shifted layers) or if you’re manually adjusting the speed of printing to more than 100%, use **Hi-power mode**.

#### Auto power mode

There is also an **Auto Power Mode**. This is basically a compromise between silent and hi-power modes. The stepper currents depend on the Z height. The current starts low when the Z height is minimal. And it increases slowly as the object is printed.

**These modes can be changed in two ways:**

1. When idle:

_LCD Menu - > Settings -> [Hi-power mode / Silent mode / Auto power mode]_

2. During a print:

_LCD Menu - > Tune -> [Hi-power mode / Silent mode / Auto power mode]_

# [SD card sorting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sd-card-sorting_2214)

The order of the files on the SD card can be changed. Change the sorting method in the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> Sort: [name/date/no sorting]._

Folders are always shown on the top of the list.

The maximum number of files which can be displayed is 100. If there are more than 100 files on the SD card, only the first 100 will be displayed.

# [Factory reset (MK2S/MK2.5S/MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mk2s-mk2-5s-mk3s_2216)

A **factory reset** can be used during troubleshooting to wipe configuration, calibration, and statistics data from your printer's memory.

There are two ways how to perform a factory reset. The procedure depends on your firmware version. First, find out your firmware version number by navigating to _LCD menu - support - Firmware._ Once you know the version number, use the corresponding instructions below. **We recommend keeping your printer's firmware up to date.**

### Firmware 3.0.11 and newer

With this firmware release, we made the **Factory reset** significantly easier to perform. Simply follow these **3 steps below:**

1. Press and release the reset button marked X and positioned under the control knob on the LCD panel.
2. Immediately press and hold the Control knob until "Factory reset" is displayed on the LCD display (after 2-3 seconds). _Depending on your settings, you will also get a sustained beep._
3. Release the control knob and a new menu should appear.



#### The LCD screen will show a menu with the following options:

* **Language:** Resets language preference and enables you to choose a new language.
* **Statistics:** Will erase all records of print time and used material from the memory.
* **Shipping prep:** Resets only the printer language selection. All the calibration data including the Liveadjust Z remain intact. Even though the calibration data are still present and functional, the printer will ask the user to run the Calibrate Z function. This “light” factory reset is mainly used to reset assembled printers before we ship them out of the factory so that users can select their language and run Calibrate Z after unpacking.
* **Service prep (starting from firmware 3.10.0):** The same as Shipping prep, but does not clear the print statistics.
* **All data:** Resets everything including all calibration data, meaning the whole EEPROM is erased. After this reset, the user is expected to go through the calibration flow again, with the exception of the sensor height setting.
* **Bowden length** ( _only for Multimaterial firmware_ ): This option is used when you want to change the Bowden cable setup, and the length of new cables is different from the original factory parts. After the reset, you can adjust the length on this menu.



### Firmware 3.0.8 to 3.0.11 ( _Before May 2017_ )

1. **Press and release the reset button** (marked X and positioned under the control knob on the LCD panel)
2. Once you see the text "Original Prusa i3 Prusa Research", **QUICKLY press and hold the control knob** until you hear a beep
3. **Release the control knob**



If done correctly, the printer LCD screen will show the language selection.

The full reset procedure is a bit more complex to avoid an accidental reset, which would be followed by a 20-minute-long calibration process.

1. **Press and release the reset button** (marked X and positioned under the control knob on the LCD panel)
2. Once you see the text "Original Prusa i3 Prusa Research", **QUICKLY press and hold the control knob** until you hear a beep
3. **Release the control knob**
4. **Immediately press and hold the control knob** until you hear a double beep
5. **Release the control knob**



If done correctly, the printer LCD screen will show the language selection.

# [Pronterface and USB cable](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pronterface-and-usb-cable_2222)

Pronterface is an application where you can monitor and send commands to your printer. It is also possible to use it to start prints over USB, however, performance may vary.

Pronterface is part of the Printrun, a suite of 3D printer software, you can [**download the latest release on GitHub**](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun/releases/latest) **.**

Pronterface used to be part of the Drivers & Apps package until the version 2.5. If you have this old version intalled, you likely already have Pronterface installed as well.

### Setting up USB connection and Pronterface

1. Connect the printer to your computer with the USB type B cable that you have received with your printer.
2. Choose the connection port in Pronterface. Mac users use _/usbmodem_ port, PC Windows ports are COM1, COM2, etc.; the correct port is displayed in the device manager, Linux users connect the printer using the virtual serial port. When the printer is connected, click the Connect button. The right column displays the connection information.



**'RPi port' must be set to OFF within Settings, in the printer's LCD menu,** to be able to connect to the printer by USB.

3. The next step is to load the model with the Load model button and to choose the **file name.gcode** (no special symbols are allowed in the file name).
4. You can control the movement of all printer axes in the control area.
5. Next, you can preheat the printer and prepare it for printing. Set the temperature for the nozzle (heater) and heatbed (bed) and click the Set button. The printer will start heating immediately. _**Always make sure that the temperature set in Pronterface is correct for the given material.**_
6. You can check the actual temperatures of the nozzle and the bed in Pronterface.
7. When the model is loaded, the right column shows the estimated print duration: **Estimated duration (pessimistic).**



Keep in mind that when printing through Pronterface, the

**c** **omputer** **must** **be** **connected** **t** **o** **t** **he printer** **during** **t** **he** **entire** **printing** **process**

\- the computer must be prevented from going into sleep mode, hibernation, or shut down. Disconnecting the computer during the print ends the printing process without the option to finish the object.

### How to operate Pronterface

1. The Load file button is used to load the desired model. The model must be in **.gcode** file format.
2. Choose the port to which the printer is connected to the computer. (mostly _/usbmodem_ for Mac, COM1, COM2, etc. for Windows PC).
3. The Print button starts the printing process.
4. The Disconnect button disconnects the printer from the computer.
5. The printer controls give you the ability to manipulate the printer axes.
6. Setting the **nozzle** and **bed temperatures**.
7. **Thermometer**.
8. Confirming the set temperatures, heating starts.
9. 2D print process **preview.**
10. Info panel. **Estimated print time** , axis position, and other info show up after loading the model.

# [Firmware updating issues (MK2S/MK3S/MMU2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-issues-mk2s-mk3s-mmu2s_2225)

Flashing the firmware can sometimes fail, but most of the time it is nothing major. Before going deeper into issues related to flashing your printer, there are some initial steps and prerequisites that should be tested.

### Initial checks

* Read the article again. Verify that you have followed all instructions in the [How to update firmware (MK3S+/MK3S/MK3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk3s-mk3s-mk3_2227) article word by word.
* There is always a small chance that the problem was just a **"one time bug"**. Therefore, we suggest always trying to do the normal firmware update again, just to make sure.
* Make sure that the latest [DRIVERS & APPS package](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) is installed on your computer before flashing the firmware. Sometimes, **uninstalling all programs from Prusa** , downloading the Drivers, and **installing them again** solves the problem.
* PrusaSlicer will detect the USB-connected printer even when it is powered off, but in order to upgrade the firmware, **the printer has to be powered on!**
* **Do not connect both USB cables at the same time!** Each firmware must be flashed separately and only one logic board can be connected at a time.
* Make sure you have no other serial-connection running on your printer at the time of flashing. This includes Arduino IDE, Serial bridges, or other COM devices running.
* **FOR MMU2S - If the signal cable to the MMU2S unit is plugged incorrectly you can have issues flashing.**



### Common updating & flashing problems

#### Another cable and USB port

First of all, please try to use **another USB port** of your computer. Then hit the **Rescan** button in the Firmware flasher tool in PrusaSlicer.

Make sure the USB cable is inserted all the way on both sides, and maybe try another cable as well.

**Do not unplug** the USB cable before the Firmware Updater tool in PrusaSlicer confirms that the process was successfully completed.

#### Timeout error

The Firmware Updater tool is not getting a response from the mini RAMBo or EINSY RAMBo board. Check that your printer is powered on. The next step is to check your fuses, you can visit these articles for more information: [Blown Fuse (MK2S/MK2.5/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2111) or [Blown Fuse (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_1925).

#### Uploading different file

_"Wrong file has been selected for flashing"._ Make sure to **unpack the .zip archive** with the firmware and **select the .hex file for your printer model.**

#### Flashing failed error

When you see a status message “Flashing failed. Please see the avrdude log below.”, click the “Advanced: Output log” button to see the full flashing log. This log can provide more information about the reason for the failure.

In case you see at the end of the log a message “Could not open port: COM4” (or another COM port number), this can have multiple causes.

The above error can be accompanied by an error “stk500v2_getsync(): timeout communicating with programmer” (as in the picture above). When that’s the case, check if:

* Another software like Cura or Pronterface is not running and is not connected to that port. When unsure, try to close all open programs or restart your computer.
* You are not trying to flash the Einsy firmware .hex file to the MMU2S board or the MMU2S firmware .hex file to the Einsy board.
* Your printer is powered on. If it’s powered on, the next step is to check your fuses. You can visit these articles for more information: [Blown Fuse (MK2S/MK2.5/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk2s-mk2-5-mk2-5s_2111) or [Blown Fuse (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_1925).



When the error “Could not open port: COM4” is accompanied by the error “arduino_open(): Failed to initialize MK3 external flash programming mode”, check your LCD screen for any further error messages.

#### COM port/device

Check if the printer is showing up in the Device Manager as a **COM device**.

Sometimes, the printer shows up in the Device Manager, but **not among COM devices** \- If you can find the printer in the Device Manager, but not as a COM device, follow these steps:

1. Reinstall the drivers from the installation folder:
*       * _C: Program Files Prusa3D Rambo dpinstx64.exe (64-bit systems)_ **or**
* _C:Program Files Prusa3D Rambo dpinstx86.exe_ (32-bit systems)
2. Restart your PC after you do so.
3. Check if the printer is showing up in Device Manager as a **COM device.** Use that COM port and manually fill it in the port section in the software.



If the Firmware flasher gives you an error saying it is **not able to communicate** on COM3 or another port, check your Port settings - some **other device may be using that port**. Eject that device, or change its com port to another number, and restart your computer.

#### Squares on the LCD

After flashing the firmware, does your **LCD show only squares?** If the LCD and menu were working correctly before the firmware update, then **firmware for different a printer model was flashed.** Make sure you selected the correct one (MK2.5S/ MK3S/ Multimaterial).

The firmware for the MK3(S) does not have different HEX-files for different revisions of the Einsy Rambo, as you will find for the MK2S and the miniRAMBO.

### None of the problems are permanent

The core of the printer's system (bootloader) is "read-only" which means that even if you upload an incorrect firmware or make any other mistake, there is always a way to make things right. The best practice when uploading or flashing simply does not work is to follow the steps for a [Factory reset (MK2S/MK2.5S/MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mk2s-mk2-5s-mk3s_2216) of all data **.**

# [How to update firmware (MK3S+/MK3S/MK3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk3s-mk3s-mk3_2227)

Updating the firmware is **recommended for all users** as every new version brings new features and fixes.

**To utilize the new SuperPINDA, your MK3S must at least have firmware version 3.9.2!**

To flash the firmware onto your printer, you need:

* Computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
* USB cable, preferably the original included with your printer
* PrusaSlicer and the printer's driver installed (download [here](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/))



To check which firmware version you already have on your printer, power it up and go to _LCD menu - > Support_. Scroll down and you will see the firmware version **. The procedure for installing an older version of the firmware (downgrading) is exactly the same.**

If you want to flash the firmware, the printer must be

**on**

.

### **Preparations**

* **PrusaSlicer and the printer's driver must be installed.** If you do not have this installed, it is found in the Drivers and Apps package available where you download the latest firmware.
* Enter our [our downloads section](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) and download the firmware (green square). To find the correct firmware, see the name and picture of the printers/upgrades and compare it to your machine. **Be aware that Original Prusa MK3 and MK3S do not use the same firmware file. _However, MK3S and MK3S+ use the same firmware._**




### Flashing procedure

1. To flash the firmware into your printer, connect the RAMBo board to your computer using the square-shaped **USB-B 2.0 cable**. The printer must be ON!


2. Unzip the .zip-file to a folder on your computer.
3. Open PrusaSlicer, click on the 'Configuration' menu, and select 'Flash printer firmware' (left picture).
4. Click on the **Browse** button (green arrow right picture) and choose the .hex file from the location you **unzipped** it. _The file name with the firmware for the MK3S is **prusa3d_fw_MK3S_x_x_x_xxx** where the **x** is the firmware version number._
5. Make sure the Serial Port field (red square right picture) displays your printer's name (Original Prusa i3 MK3) and has a COM port assigned (ex. COM4). Click Flash! and let the procedure complete. _Progress is indicated on both the Firmware flasher and the printer's display._



If the Serial port field display anything but the name of the printer (ex. usbmodemfa141 or /dev/tty.

_usbmodem_

) you should try another USB port on your computer, reinstall the driver or restart your computer.

# [MMU2S Setup and Inspection](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-setup-and-inspection_2233)

**After successfully finishing the build of your Original Prusa MMU2S** upgrade and going through [8\. Preflight check & Calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-preflight-check-calibration_219068) of the assembly manual you should be good to go. However, if you are encountering persistant issues, we have compiled a checklist of what you want to double-check.

For more details about the Multi-Material Upgrade components and their place in the assembly, you can consult our

[360 viewer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/360-viewer_1877)

.

### Necessary calibrations

With the hundreds of filament changes that can go into a single MMU print, the system needs to know where each filament is at all times. Therefore, there are two sensors, that both have to be set up properly. You can see if they trigger correctly on the LCD menu under _Support - > Sensor info_. Each should trigger "1" of filament is present and "0" when it's not.

#### IR filament sensor calibration

This is one of the two sensors on the MMU2S, located on the extruder of the printer. Before you start printing, make sure your IR filament sensor mechanism is [ properly calibrated](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-calibration-mmu2s_2245).

#### SuperFINDA sensor calibration

The SuperFINDA is the second sensor on the MMU2S. Its position is crucial to ensure smooth operation. Its assembly can also collect debris or strings from filament changes. To set it up and inspect it, please see [FINDA setup and troubleshooting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-setup-and-troubleshooting_2250).

### Hardware configurations

#### Idler screws tension

Just like the [extruder idler screw](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/idler-screw-tension_177367), its MMU2S counterparts need to be tightened just right. If the idler springs are over-tightened, it may cause the idler motor to skip. Over-tightening can also cause the pulleys to be "choked" by the filament.

To find the perfect tension, tighten the screw to about 0.5 mm (0.02 in) below the edge of the hole, on both sides of the idler body, and follow these steps:

1. All 5 filaments have to be loaded to the hobbed pulley's position.
2. Move the selector to the far right (5th filament position) and back, by long-pressing the right and left control buttons.
3. If you hear clicking, loosen the screws a little bit and try to move the selector again.
4. Repeat until there is no more clicking.



**If only 2-3 filaments are loaded, you may need to adjust the side without filaments a little tighter than the other.**

For example, if only filament 1, 2, and 3 is loaded, tighten the screw on the right, next to filament 5. You can use a permanent marker and make a thin line on the inner edge of the hole to mark the correct screw position for future reference.

#### **Spools and buffer positioning**

The spool holders shouldn't be too close to each other. Ideally, the spools should be positioned as described and shown in the handbook (picture below).

If you decide for any reason not to use the long PTFE tubes, or not to use the filament buffer, you have to make sure the filaments will not be tangling one into another. Also, make sure the spools are stable and won't tip over. Spools which are almost empty is more prone to cause problems with tangling or falling over.

### Assembly inspection

#### Idler Bearings

The five bearings that are protruding from the idler cylinder **must be spinning freely on their shafts**. If that is not the case, you can always remove and inspect the bearing by pushing out the shaft from the opposite side they are inserted. Use a rod or Allen key at least 100 mm (~4 in) long.

#### Securing the idler on the shaft

The idler cylinder has to be secured by two M3x10 screws which act as grub set screws on the MMU2S extruder motor shaft.

Be

**extremely careful**

during the tightening! If these screws are too loose, you will have problems with loading and unloading the filament, and if you overtighten these two screws, the idler will

**crack**

.

Keep in mind that these two M3x10 screws might also get loose over time, so check the tightening every few dozen print hours. Another potential issue for you to verify is whether the two screws are tightened against the flat part of the extruder motor shaft. See [4\. Idler body assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-idler-body-assembly_42472#42952) of the assembly manual.

#### Idler rotation

The idler must have some space on the left or right side and around the circumference of the idler barrel (see the light blue spacers in the picture below). The solution is to move the idler barrel a little bit away from the idler body and extend the gap. Around 1 mm (0.04 in) gap on both sides is more than enough. Test by rotating the idler by hand when the printer is off.

#### Align the pulleys

The filaments are being pushed through the MMU2S unit using 5 hobbed pulleys, mounted on the long shaft of the pulley motor. The grub screws must be:

* Oriented on the left side of the teeth, away from the Pulley motor.
* **Perfectly aligned with the filament holes and filament** , as shown in the photo below.
* Secured by the small black grub screw against **the flat side of the Pulley motor shaft.**



Over time, filament dust may accumulate in the teeth of the pulleys. The best practice is regularly to clean them with a mini-brush or a similar tool.

#### Short PTFE tubes orientation

After the filament is grabbed by the hobbed pulley, it is pushed into one of the five 19 mm (0.75 inches) PTFE tubes. These tubes are chamfered on one end, which provides some extra space for the unloaded filament, as the tip might be slightly thicker than the rest of the filament. Therefore, **the chamfered end must be facing out** , away from the pulleys, as explained in [5\. Pulley body assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-pulley-body-assembly_43152#43760) of the Assembly manual.

#### Rear PTFE holder overtightened

This holds the long PTFE tubes where you feed in filament to the MMU2S. Before tightening the four M3x18 screws, make sure that:

* The half-circular grooves are perfectly **aligned with the half-circular grooves of the pulley body**.
* The screws are **not tightened too much,** deforming the long PTFE tubes, changing their inner diameter.
* The long PTFE tubes have been inserted all the way in, past the holder, touching the Pulley body. _The corresponding steps in the assembly manual are[Step 13 and 14](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-electronics-and-mmu2s-unit-assembly_44728#45296)._



#### **Selector blade**

Make sure the little blade that is supposed to cut filament strings is **secured in place** with two M3x10 screws. For more info please see [MMU2S Selector not moving](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-selector-not-moving_1997).

### Slicer settings

The shape of the filament tip is very important for a successful MMU2S print. The tip should be pointy but **without any** **lump or string**. The diameter of the tip can be slightly bigger than the rest of the filament, but not by much.

First of all, try to adjust the hotend temperature (increase or decrease it by increments of 2°C) which in most cases will solve the problem. You can do so during the print in the [Tune Menu](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tune-menu_151141) or when slicing the model.

If the problem persists, head back to PrusaSlicer and increase **the number of cooling moves by 2 or 3** from _Filament settings - > Advanced -> Number of cooling moves_). Furthermore, you can try to increase the **unloading speed** by increments of 10 mm/s from _Filament settings - > Advanced -> Unloading speed_.

### Test prints

If you are sure that all potential issues mentioned above have been avoided, feel free to try these test G-codes (sliced for your **MK3S/MK3S+** \+ MMU2S upgrade):

# [IR filament sensor calibration (MMU2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-calibration-mmu2s_2245)

When used with the new **Multi Material Upgrade 2S** , the new IR filament sensor needs to be calibrated before first use, in order to work properly. The calibration of the IR sensor is based on the position of the chimney (IR sensor holder) on the extruder. This calibration is purely mechanical. There is a warning in the assembly manual and the exact procedure is also described in the MMU2S Handbook you have received printed in the MMU package.

#### **What does it look like**

Even when there is no filament inserted in the MMU2S extruder, it is possible the sensor assumes the opposite. In a similar way, even during a print when the filament is in the extruder, it is possible the sensor suddenly stops registering it. It might then trigger filament change, or the 'Spool join' feature if you have it enabled.

Since the 3.7.2 firmware version, the printer is able to test the functionality of the IR sensor by itself during the Selftest.

#### **How to fix it**

First of all, make sure your printer is running on **firmware** version 3.6.0 or higher. You should be always running on the latest [firmware version for your printer model](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk3s-mk3s-mk3_2227).

We need to **calibrate the position** of the chimney that houses the filament sensor. The MMU2S modification of the MK3S extruder consists of 3 plastic parts: the FS-cover-mmu2s, the IR-sensor-holder-mmu2s, and the IR-sensor-cover-mmu2s. During the following procedure, **move only with the IR-sensor-holder-mmu2s** , for simplicity, we will continue calling this specific part "the chimney".

1. Unscrew the Festo fitting of the PTFE tube leading from the MMU to the extruder.


2. Open the _LCD menu - > Support -> Sensor info_ and focus on the **_IR value_** _(Fil. Sensor)_. _In firmware version 3.10.0 and newer this value is referred to as **Fil. Sensor.**_



The IR sensor (Fil. Sensor) value has to be a stable 0 when there is no filament and a stable 1 as long as the filament is present in the extruder.

3. Loosen both M3 screws on the chimney. Move the chimney as far left as possible until the IR value (Fil. Sensor) is 0.
4. Tighten the M3 screws on the chimney.
5. Insert the smallest 1.5 mm Allen key (ideally the long one included in the MMU kit) instead of a filament into the extruder (without preheating), **push it in between the Bondtech gears to move the lever** (don't be afraid to apply a fair amount of downward force in order to get the key in between the gears). If the IR sensor (Fil. Sensor) value turns to 1, the calibration is done correctly.
6. If the IR sensor (Fil. Sensor) value stays at 0, pull out the Allen key from the extruder. Loosen the M3 screws on the chimney and move the chimney a tiny little bit to the right. Return back to step 4.



Check the chimney for little strings left after printing. These need to be cleaned out before attaching the IR sensor as it needs to have a clear field of view.

#### **What if it does not work**

Keep in mind that the idler screw tension is important too (idler screw is the one with the spring on it). The head of this screw should be flush with the extruder body, or slightly protruding from the left side.

* If the value is stuck on either 0 or 1 and it **does not change** , you may have overtightened the M3x40 screw that serves as the axle of the idler door. Try to loosen it a little bit.



The same applies to the

**M3x40 pressure screw**

with the spring on it - the head of this screw should be

**flush with the Extruder body.**

* Another screw that must not be overtightened is the **M2x8 screw going through the IR sensor.** Try to loosen it a little bit if it's screwed in tight, or, alternatively, tighten it if the sensor board is loose.
* Also, check if your IR sensor PCB is not loose. If it is, it can slightly rotate around the screw which can influence the readings. The IR sensor board must be **perpendicular to the lever.**
* In case the **sensor keeps showing 1** even though the chimney is pushed all the way to the left, you first should make sure the filament was unloaded and changed correctly. [Make sure the Bondtech gear is aligned](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/checking-re-aligning-the-bondtech-gear-mk3s-mk2-5s_133176).
* It might be necessary **to cut a small dent (roughly 0.5 mm)** at the top of the lever with an Exacto knife. **Do not remove more than 2 or 3 filament layers!** It is very easy to clean up too much for the sensor to be functional, in which case you must print a new idler. Consider having a spare before doing so, or you must disconnect both the power and signal cable of the MMU2S to use the printer in single filament mode.

# [FINDA setup and troubleshooting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-setup-and-troubleshooting_2250)

The FINDA sensor, sometimes referred to as F.I.N.D.A. is essentially the MK2/S PINDA sensor (without thermistor), upcycled to be used as a filament sensor. It is triggered by the proximity of the stainless steel ball. When the filament is pushed through the selector, it raises the ball towards the FINDA. There is a small red LED light on the top of the sensor that **turns OFF when the filament is detected**. When the filament is removed, the stainless steel ball falls back down and the red light turns ON.

The FINDA is

**not**

the same as the P.I.N.D.A. or SuperPINDA used on the MK2.5S and MK3/S/+ extruder. These are not interchangeable with the FINDA and it is important to differentiate the different Original Prusa induction sensors.

_The FINDA sensor must be distanced correctly from the steel ball ( blue ruler \- left picture) so it is triggered **only** when filament is present (green arrow \- right picture), pushing the steel ball higher._

### FINDA height setup

The FINDA sensor has to be properly inserted into its socket: **not too low, not too high**. Check out our assembly manual, specifically [this step](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-preflight-check-calibration_219068#219933), to see how the FINDA fits in.

1. Supposing the steel ball and the FINDA are still in the selector, loosen the M3x10 screw holding the FINDA in place. Do not remove the screw, you just need to be able to move the FINDA up and down.
2. Open the _LCD menu - > Support -> Sensor info_ and focus on the **FINDA value.**
3. Insert any 1.75 mm filament into the selector. The FINDA value **should turn from 0 to 1**.
* If it does not change from 0 to 1, **push the FINDA down** a little bit. Keep in mind you must be able to move with the filament freely!
* If it does change reliably from 0 to 1 as long as the filament is inserted, the calibration is done.



The tip of the sensor does **not need to press directly on the steel ball** in order to detect it, it is triggered by the magnetic field. Thus, do not press the FINDA down during step 3.

Finally, tighten the M3x10 screw to prevent the FINDA from moving. The steel ball, however, has to move freely!

### FINDA troubleshooting

#### Debris in the selector

As explained in the first paragraph, the steel ball has to move freely. Sometimes, however, filament **debris, dust, or strings** may amass in the hole or even in the FINDA/ball socket. **Use compressed air to clean it**.

You can also use an interdental brush to clean debris. The diameter should be around 1.5 mm (0.06”) and the length should be 10-15 mm (0.4-0.6”)

#### Faulty sensor

You can always check the proper functioning of the sensor by inserting a piece of filament and **observing the red light** on top of the sensor. You can also go to the **_LCD Menu - > Support -> Sensor info_** to see the FINDA status. It should be 0 when the filament is out (red LED on) and 1 when the filament is inserted into the selector (red LED off).

In some situations, the FINDA itself may be working but its **cable might be damaged** and fail to transfer the information to the logic board. In most cases, it can be damaged during the assembly while doing cable management. It can be also damaged by opening the Idler body all the way and having it hang on the cables.

The best way to check the cable is to insert a piece of filament into the selector and go to the Sensor info menu. The FINDA value should be 1. Then **wiggle with the cable** and see if the value flickers and changes to 0 at any point.

#### Wiring

In case the FINDA value in the Sensor info menu is **N/A** during manual testing, check [the cable connection to the MMU logic board](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-electronics-and-mmu2s-unit-assembly_44728) and the MMU cable connection into the RAMBo board ([MK3S](https://help.prusa3d.com) / [MK2.5S](https://help.prusa3d.com)). Pay attention to the **order of the colors** of the individual wires. **However, during load and unload, the FINDA value in the Sensor info menu will be N/A.**

# [Linear Advance](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/linear-advance_2252)

This is an

**advanced calibration**

, recommended only to

**experienced users**

.

Linear Advance (LA) is a technology that predicts the pressure build-up in the extruder when printing at higher speeds. The firmware of the printer uses that prediction to decrease the amount of filament extruded just before stopping and decelerating, which prevents blobs or artifacts at the sharp corners. What is referred to as ' **K-values** ' are the parameter determining how much Linear Advance affects the print.

With firmware 3.9.0, we introduced **Linear Advance 1.5** for the Original Prusa MK3S, MK3, MK2.5S, and MK2.5, which was further improved upon with FW 3.9.1, addressing print artifacts found in specific scenarios and geometries. **Linear Advance 1.5 is also backward compatible with version 1.0.** In case you have a G-code with Linear Advance 1.0, the printer will analyze the code and convert the values automatically.

Print profiles for the Original Prusa MINI are well-tuned. Additionally, there has never been LA1.0 on the MINI, so no conversion (to LA1.5) is required.

### Configuration

**These values are part of our PrusaSlicer configurations and filament presets. No need to adjust if you are using these.** However, if you are using filaments not present or wish to play around with the presets, we have developed a [K-factor calibration print](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/39968-la15-k-factor-calibration) together with the community, to find the perfect K-values for your material and printing temperatures. These are based on the various quality and layer height presets found in PrusaSlicer.

**This article mainly refers to the printer use with a 0.4 mm brass nozzle.**

Other nozzle sizes or materials could result in different K-values.

It will print a series of lines with different K-values affecting the speed and flow across the accelerated distance. The examples below show how the lines are affected by their K-value. The first and last 25 mm are printed slowly, and between the marked locations (red squares) 100mm is printed fast. Look closely at the transition from slow to fast and fast to slow. You see the line can be irregular to broken entirely when the value is not optimal, most visible on the top lines (red squares), but present on all except those with the optimal K-factor. You also see big differences between different materials and how much difference it can make to have this dialed in.

_Calibration G-code printed with PLA at 215 °C. Most consistent line achieved with K-value 0.05 ( green square)._

_Calibration G-code printed with ABS at 255 °C. Most consistent line achieved with K-value 0.04 ( green square)._

_Calibration G-code printed with PETG at 240 °C. Most consistent line achieved with K-value 0.08 ( green square)._

### Download calibration G-code

You can download the [K-factor calibration G-code](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/39968-la15-k-factor-calibration) from our print depository or directly from the table below. **These are for a 0.4 mm brass nozzle.** Load the correct filament type for the G-code and start the print as any other.

If your usual printing temperatures are different than what is provided, feel free to modify the G-Code lines to your needs.

Change the "S" values, which is the temperature in Celcius:

M104 S215 ; Set nozzle temperature (no wait)
M140 S60 ; set bed temp
M190 S60 ; wait for bed temp
M109 S215 ; Wait for nozzle temp

### Optimal K-values and how to adjust

The optimal values we found in our testing are listed in the tables below. These can be implemented into any slicer. Please note that different brands and colors of the same material may require a slightly different K value when printing at **extreme speeds** , however, our presets should be fine with all of them.

#### 0.4 mm nozzle

PLA0.05
PETG0.08
CPE 0.07
PC Blend0.07
ASA/ABS0.04
HIPS0.04 (some brands may need a higher K-value)
Nylon Taulman0.08
Nylon FX256 0.1

#### 0.6 mm nozzle

PLA0.04
PETG0.04 - 0.05
PC Blend0.04
ASA/ABS0.02 - 0.03
HIPS0.03 (some brands may need a higher K-value)

Be careful when setting new K-values. Changing them is

**recommended only for experienced users**

. Back up your settings before you adjust them.

#### PrusaSlicer

As mentioned, the K-values for all filaments are already implemented into PrusaSlicer's presets. If you need to adjust these settings due to some exotic filament or a specific application, the K-value is set in the custom G-code section in the _Filament Settings tab_ , NOT under the printer-specific custom G-code.

* **The blue arrow and box show the number to change for a 0.6 mm nozzle.**
* **The green arrow and box show the number to change for a 0.4mm nozzle.**



#### Other slicers

If you are using a different slicer than our PrusaSlicer, you must manually change the settings in the G-code script of your slicer.

**Simplify3D, Cura, etc.** users just need to add “M900 Kxx” into the starting G-code script. Keep in mind you need to manually change that for different filament materials. **Only PrusaSlicer has a custom G-code for each filament preset** and therefore the K value is changed automatically. Set the desired speed and print something (large enough for speed to show up). If sharp corners have blobs, **increase the K value**. If you see missing filament, **decrease the K value**.

Users of Simplify3D, Cura, etc. should change their LA adjustments in their slicer when they install firmware 3.9.0 or newer!

# [Extruder linearity correction calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extruder-linearity-correction-calibration_2254)

This is an

**advanced calibration**

, recommended only to

**experienced users**

.

This calibration only works on the firmware version 3.2.0 or newer and only works on the Original Prusa MK3 and MK3S, due to the Trinamic stepper drivers of the

[Einsy RAMBo](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107)

.

Linearity correction is based on the Trinamic stepper driver feature that allows defining a custom current-waveform. The default Trinamic waveform is a sine function, but the real waveform can be a little bit different and depends on the stepper motor type. Also, motors of the same type can have different waveforms. The biggest distortion appears when the wave is crossing the zero point (or around it), so the original sine wave is modified using power function to eliminate this distortion.

This article addresses linear correction for the Extruder only.

## Linearity correction calibration procedure

1. Go to your printer's LCD menu -> Settings -> Lin.Correction->E correct, and then turn it off
2. Download and print the [Calibration g-code](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36709-extruder-linearity-correction-calibration-tower)
3. You will observe that some diagonal moire lines will appear on the tower. Find a place with the best surface on the calibration object.



Focus especially on 45-degree lines visible as a darker reflection

4. Most printers will have minimal distortion around the vertical center of the object (value 1.10), but yours might be different. **Note your ideal value.**


5. Enable the E-correction again in LCD menu -> Settings -> Lin.Correction->E correct. Adjust the value to the one that you were happy with.

In **firmware 3.13.0** and newer, there has been a change in the menu numbering system for the correction factor, ranging from 0 to 200.

Here's how it corresponds:

Correction factor 1.03 is represented as 030 in the menu.
Correction factor 1.11 is represented as 110 in the menu.

6. Print something and see if the diagonal lines are still there. If so, please go back to **step 3**.

# [Extrusion multiplier calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extrusion-multiplier-calibration_2257)

This is an

**advanced calibration**

, recommended only to

**experienced users**

.

The Extrusion Multiplier allows the fine-tuning of the extrusion flow rate - simply described as **how much filament comes out of the nozzle**. In other words, the **Extrusion Multiplier** setting in PrusaSlicer and the **Flow rate** setting in printer firmware are two ways to adjust the same thing, however, adjusting one of those two settings will not influence the value of the other.

**This procedure is not necessary with a new printer coming from the factory** , but rather applies for specific applications and filaments. The ideal value is different for every type of material and every color. It can even differ from spool to spool. Bear this in mind if you change type and brand of filament often or use cheap no-name brands.

Total flow rate =

**Flow multiplier**

in firmware (M221) x

**Extrusion multiplier**

in PrusaSlicer. For those interested in diving deeper, PrusaSlicer uses the same

[Flow math as Slic3r](https://manual.slic3r.org/advanced/flow-math)

.

### **How to spot an issue**

This calibration is used to fix two common problems:

* **Overextrusion** \- Too much material is extruded (flow is too high). It causes scarring of bottom layers and unnecessary material buildup on top layers.
* **Minor under extrusion** \- Not enough material is extruded (flow is too low). It causes small gaps that appear between layer lines or perimeters.



**Overextrusion** is a common problem with many filament brands. It's especially problematic when you're trying to glue two parts of the model. **If the top layer is over extruded, you'll end up with an uneven surface that will prevent a seamless connection between the two pieces.**

### **How to do the calibration**

In PrusaSlicer, navigate to Filament Settings and look for Extrusion Multiplier. The default setting (for PLA) is 1, this value represents a percentage, 1 = 100%, 0.95 = 95% etc. Usually, the adjusted values can be between 0.9 and 1.1. To adjust it, simply rewrite the value.

In the printer menu, during a print, go to the Tune menu and then choose Flow. Again, the usual values can range between 90 and 110, although that does not mean you can't go above or below that.

#### Which method should I use?

There are two methods you can use to calibrate the Extrusion Multiplier, and we'll cover both of them in this article:

* **Precise Method** \- using precision tools such as calipers or micrometers.
* **Visual Method** \- an easy method based on observing the visual properties of your models.



The choice of the method depends entirely on your preferences; in the end, both yield similar results. Even the visual method will enable you to have perfectly fitting parts with smooth & flat top layers.

#### Precise Method

Please note that the following guide is based on **default** PrusaSlicer 0.4 nozzle profiles, with a layer height of 0.1mm - 0.2mm. This means that:
\- Nozzle size = 0.4
\- Extrusion width = 0.45
\- Basic materials (PLA, ABS, PETG) Extrusion Multiplier = 1
**If you wish to calibrate the printer with a bigger/smaller nozzle or layer heights above 0.2, then you will need to adjust these values as well.**

1. Download the [Precision Method Cube STL](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cube-40-40-40.zip).
2. Slice it using the Vase Mode and your most-often used layer height and print it. You can find Vase mode (Print Settings → Layers and perimeters → Spiral vase).
3. Make three or more measurements in the middle of each wall and calculate the overall average thickness.
4. Calculate the extrusion multiplier using the following formula: **Extrusion multiplier = (Extrusion width (0.45) / Average measured wall thickness)**.
5. Adjust the Extrusion Multiplier in Filament Settings → Filament
6. Re-print the cube with new settings and go back to step 3 if necessary.



Please note that cheap digital calipers may not be accurate enough to make reliable measurements of a single perimeter wall.

#### Visual Method

This method does not require any tools, only your sight. The point is to make sure your top layers are **smooth** , **shiny,** and without **scarring or filament buildup** near the perimeters.

1. Download the [Visual Method Cube.stl](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/visual-method-cube.zip)
2. Slice it using the default Prusa PLA presets at 0.20mm layer height and print it.
3. Inspect the top layer of your cube visually and with the tip of the finger.
4. If the top is under extruded or not smooth, then re-adjust the Extrusion Multiplier accordingly by 1-2%.
5. Repeat the steps above as long as needed.



If there is **too much material** near the perimeters, **decrease** the Extrusion Multiplier value.

If there are **visible gaps** between layer lines, **increase** the Extrusion Multiplier value. (Microscopic gaps near the perimeters are OK.)

# [PID tuning](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pid-tuning_2265)

PID tuning is a calibration procedure that ensures the printer holds a stable target temperature at all times. PID (Proportional Integral Derivate) is used on the Original Prusa printers to maintain a stable temperature **on the hotend**. You can use the PID tuning to calibrate its values in case you are experiencing small fluctuations in temperature readings of your printer's nozzle (e.g +/- 5 °C).

If you are experiencing major temperature fluctuations,

**higher than +/-5 °C**

, there could be a problem with your fan or thermistor wire/connector.

### How to perform PID tuning

Starting with firmware version 2.0.12., PID tuning is an optional calibration procedure, which is super easy to perform. It can be found in the _LCD Menu - > Calibration -> PID calibration._

1. Once you open the **PID calibration** menu, set the temperature at which the calibration should run.
2. To achieve optimal results, select a temperature you use most often during your prints (e.g. the temperature for PLA, PETG, or other favorite material).



The PID tuning will increase the stability for all temperatures, it is not necessary to make it multiple times for different temperatures.

3. The nozzle will heat up to the selected temperature in 5 cycles. During these cycles, the printer will determine the amount of power needed to reach the user-defined temperature and maintain it.



Be aware that PID tuning is not a solution for every temperature fluctuation issue. Always make sure that your printer is located in a dry environment with a stable temperature over 20 °C and no breeze.

# [Bed Level Correction](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/bed-level-correction_2267)

**This calibration is for advanced users only!**

Together with the Mesh Bed Leveling, the **Bed Level Correction** is an important feature designed to allow users to compensate for even the slightest imperfections in the first layer. It allows to virtually **raise or lower the heatbed on the Left, Right, Front and Back sides** , essentially enabling you to have a different [Live Adjust Z value](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364) on each of the four sides of the heatbed. This feature is most beneficial if you frequently need to use the entire area of the heatbed.

Before you start the calibration, make sure there is nothing between the steel sheet and the heatbed.

#### How to use Bed Level Correction

Starting from **firmware 3.5.2** , the adjustment limit is +/- 100 microns (μm) instead of +/- 50 microns (μm) in the previous versions. Even 20 microns can make a huge difference, so when using this function, **make small** incremental changes. Just like in the Live-Z adjust, negative values lower the nozzle closer to the heatbed.

Before we begin,

**make sure you have recently run the[XYZ calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_112351) and have cleaned the entire surface of your heatbed**

with 90%+ isopropyl alcohol.

1. Run a [First Layer Calibration (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364) to get a good baseline calibration.
2. Download and slice [this test model](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36706-bed-level-test) for your printer version using the Prusa Slicer's default PLA settings, 0.20 mm layer height.
3. Print the g-code prepared in the previous step with a PLA filament (ideally light and opaque color). The print is just one layer high and takes up most of the printable surface. You do not have to print the entire file, stop the print as soon as the differences in layer height across the plate are obvious.
4. Evaluate where the layer is too squished and full of scars and where there are gaps in between the lines. In the photo below, the lines are way too squished in the top-right corner, and the nozzle is too far away in the bottom-left.



**In the example above you want to adjust a minus-value on the left, bringing the nozzle closer and a plus-value on the right, moving the nozzle away. You may also need to adjust the distance front and back, but do a test print after adjusting the left and right side.**

5. Go to the _LCD Menu - > Calibration -> Bed level correction_. There, you can adjust Left/Right/Front/Rear values (understood from your point of view, as you are looking at the printer's LCD).
6. Edit the values, we suggest going in steps of +/- 10. These values will be **added to the baseline Live Z** value set in step 1. **Remember, a negative value will decrease the distance between the nozzle making the layer more squished. A positive value will increase the nozzle-bed distance, curing the scars on your first layer.**
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until you are satisfied with the result (photo below for inspiration).



For example, let's say your Live adjust Z value is -1.000 and that the layer is too squished in the rear and that you see gaps between the lines on the right side.

* Rear: you need to enter a positive value (at the end it will be 25 for example) to make the layer less squished
* Right: you need to enter a negative value (at the end it will be -10 for example) to make the layer more squished



The Bed Level Correction values are reset to 0 every time you start the Calibration Wizard or the XYZ calibration. Once you find your ideal values,

**write them down**

as a backup.

# [XYZ Calibration details](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-details_2272)

Starting with the firmware version 3.0.12, more detailed information about XYZ calibration results becomes available. This feature can be found in _LCD menu - > Support -> XYZ cal. details._

The first screen tells you the distance of the “perfect” position of your front 1st, 2nd, and 3rd calibration points. Ideally, all of these are positive and at least 0.5 mm or more. If the margin is between 0 and 0.4 mm, then there is a chance that your calibration will not be successful ("[XYZ calibration failed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/calibration-failed_2033)" error).

For the Original Prusa MK2/S, in order to improve your results, you should

[adjust the threaded rods](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/misaligned-pinda-sensor-mk2-s_2016)

of the frame so that all of the points can be reached during the calibration process.

To achieve the best results, aim for the smallest possible difference between Left and Right numbers. A difference of up to 0.1mm is considered good.

Pressing the knob will take you to the second screen. This screen identifies how far you are from the perfect perpendicularity. It is measuring the skew of your X/Y axis.

* Over 0.25° = **Severe skew compensating** for the offset of 1.1 mm on 250 mm length
* Between 0.25° and 0.12° = **Slight skew compensating** for the offset of 0.5 mm on 250 mm length
* Under 0.12° = **No need to compensate** , X and Y axis are perpendicular. Congratulations!



It may seem that the compensations are not that significant. However, if we take into consideration the 250 mm X-axis length, 1.1 mm is a large margin. In order to improve your axis perpendicularity, make sure the difference in the front calibration points distance is minimal.

When you get your axes perpendicular or just slightly skewed, nothing needs to be tweaked as the printer will perform with the best accuracy.

# [Assembly manuals](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/assembly-manuals_2273)

One of the best things about getting your very first 3D printer kit is the assembly. Building your first 3D printer may take some time, however, it's **the perfect way** to get to know the machine in detail. Not only that, but it's also a lot of fun to put the whole machine together.

The length of the assembly depends on the type of the printer and generally takes several hours, complicated setups (e.g. MK3S + MMU2S) can day or two. However it is not a race, so take your time, follow the instructions and **enjoy the construction!**

## Our manuals

* Each **kit** comes with a printed assembly manual ( **MMU2S assembly manual is only available online** ). If you would like to see the photos in full resolution, you can always visit [our online manuals](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/category/assembly-manuals_272). Choose the language and product you are assembling. Pay attention to your **printer version** (e.g., MK3 assembly differs from the MK3S).
* Our manuals are written in **English, Czech, Spanish, Italian, German, French, and Polish.**
* We try to make our manuals easy to understand so that truly everyone, from children to elderly persons can enjoy our printers. However, if you struggle with any chapter, do not hesitate to contact our support at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e1e6eee7c8f8fafdfbe9bbeca6ebe7e5).



## Common assembly errors

1. Do not rush with the assembly as going fast through usually means that some mistakes are made in the process. And it's more time consuming to fix them than doing everything properly right from the start.
2. Once you see anything labeled in **RED,** always double-check that you followed these instructions correctly. These are usually essential steps in the whole assembly. Not following them might cause future problems, delays, and in the worst-case scenario even damage to the product.




## How hard can it be?

1. The complete assembly is quite straightforward if you follow the manual precisely.
2. Each chapter is labeled with a **level of difficulty.** That should give you an idea of what you can expect.
3. **Don't be afraid! Tens of thousands of users made it so you can make it too!**

# [Packing i3 printer for return](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/packing-i3-printer-for-return_2278)

Do you need to send your printer back for a refund or repair? Unlike when returning a single part or component, when returning an assembled Original Prusa i3 printer (MK2/S, MK2.5/s, MK3/S/+) you must follow some guidelines to prevent any damage during the transport.

In order to send any product back to us, always do so after an agreement with our

[Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287)

. Contact us on email

**[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection),**

or live chat where we are available 24/7.

### Returning for refund

No matter the reason for returning the printer, **if you are not sending it back for repair, you must include all of the tools and accessories** that came with it. That includes:

* Flexible magnetic steel sheet
* Spool of grey filament and spool holder (even if it has been opened and less than half is used)
* SD card, power cable, USB cable
* Pliers, spatula, screwdriver, Allen keys, spanner



If we have sent you some replacement parts earlier, don't forget to **send us back the original (broken) parts** too.

The price of the damaged or missing items can be subtracted from your refund

### Returning for repair

When returning the printer just for repair, you do not have to include everything.

* Tools (pliers, spatula, screwdriver, Allen key, spanner)
* Cables
* Spool holder


* **Flexible magnetic steel sheet.** _If you have more sheets, always **include** **the one that you are using when the problem happens**._
* **1 meter (40 inches) sample of the filament giving you trouble.** _This is sufficient to check moisture content and diameter to eliminate these variables._
* **SD card with the G-code and original STL file** that you had trouble printing.



### Documentation

We require some documentation of the refund in the form of the following:

* Pictures of the packing process to have approved by our shipping department.
* Prusa Service List: Download the [Prusa Service List PDF](https://www.prusa3d.com/downloads/others/PrusaServiceList_EN.pdf) and fill out the form. It can be edited from the browser and should be sent with the photo documentation.



#### Serial number

All printers have a serial number to identify them. This must be filled in when completing the Prusa Service List. This silver sticker is either [on the back of the printer's frame](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/original-prusa-serial-number_134171#original-prusa-mk-series) or in the box that the Einsy board was sent. If you are missing this sticker and/or the serial, please contact support.

### List of packaging material

#### Cardboard box

If you bought the printer assembled, please re-use the box in which you have received it. **If it was a kit, please find another suitable box.** The printer's dimensions are 420 × 420 × 380 mm (height). To accommodate for padding material and accessories the box must be a bit larger.

#### The box should have a minimum volume of:

**540 x 510 x 475 mm (height) / 21.5 × 20 × 18.5 inches.**

Make sure you use a box with thick enough cardboard. For reference, the walls of our boxes are 4 mm (~1/8 inch) thick.

#### Zip ties

You will also need some zip ties (also known as hose ties/cable ties) or similar fasteners. The smaller the length, the more you will need. We are always sending a full pack of zip ties with printer kits and upgrades.

If the zip ties are too short, remember you can always tie one zip tie to another.

#### Packaging material

Protective padding material is important. Besides the official padding, the best is bubble wrap and crumpled-up paper, like old newspapers or ads. Layer this on top and around each component being packed.

Foam peanuts or finely shredded paper are not suitable padding material!

To secure the nozzle, you will need a small piece of packaging foam of **50 × 100 × 100 mm / 2 × 4 × 4 inches.** For example, you can cut a piece of the white foam that was used in the original box. _Even if you purchased the printer as a kit, packaging foam can be found in the box where the motors were stored._

### How to pack the printer

**Do not disassemble the kit! Do not try to cram the assembled kit into its original box! If you send us your kit for repair, partially (or fully) disassembled, you will be asked to pay the price difference between the kit and the assembled printer. Moreover, it can double the time needed to settle your claim.**

#### MMU2S

If you have a Multi-Material Upgrade, follow the guide linked below to correctly pack it before starting on the printer. Add it to the printer box when instructed to.

**[Packing Multi Material upgrade for return](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/packing-multi-material-upgrade-for-return_177555) **

### I have the original box and padding material

If you have the original box and padding then please follow the guide for official packing linked below.

**[Packing i3 printer for return - Original Packing Material](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/packing-i3-printer-for-return-original-packing-material_230459)**

#### Return Process

Shipped goods have to be returned to our warehouse before we can proceed with the refund. In order to prepare the package for return, please follow the steps below:

1. **Return request:** Send an e-mail to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#553c3b333a15252720263466317b363a38), with the subject and description of your case. The e-mail must include:


*     *       * The original invoice number of the order you want to return
* A short statement informing that you want to return it.


2. **Return label:** Once we have processed your request, you will receive an email with a shipping label and further instructions on how to contact the transporter. _Don't proceed to the packing (point 3) before receiving the return label._



If you wish to use your own carrier/shipping method this is possible. However, you must provide us with a tracking number and we take no responsibility for damaged or lost cargo.

Address: Partyzánská 218/5, 17000, Prague, Czech Republic.

3. **Packing the order:** If you are sending back a complete printer and do not have the original packing material please follow our separate guides for packing:


4. **Order returned:** Once received, we will inspect the returned product and issue the refund after evaluation.



### Refund process for shipped orders

The returned product(s) will be checked for missing or damaged parts. Discrepancies could influence the refundable amount.

Once the refund process is completed on our side, you will receive the refund via the payment method you initially used (Credit card, PayPal, etc.). **Be aware that money transfers can take up to 14 business days**.

#### When we provide the shipping label/carrier

Only the initial shipping cost is refunded. We do not cover the cost of the return shipping. Since the shipping cost will be the same both ways, in practice this means that the cost of the return shipping is subtracted from the total amount you initially paid when ordering.

_Item costs €200, and the shipping costs €20. Return label costs €20._

_You will be refunded €200 (220-20)._

_Refund = Order Total - Return Label Cost_

**Initial shipping can not be refunded for partial returns!**

In these cases, only the item value can be refunded, minus the shipping cost if we provided the return label.

#### When you provide your own shipping label/carrier

If you provide a carrier and the shipping label for the return yourself, you will be refunded the full amount that you initially paid when ordering. **If you provide your own shipping then this must be stated when you contact our customer support who will then make the claim. Additionally, you must provide us with a tracking number once shipped.**

We request that you document and allow us to advise on the packing of the goods, but we take no responsibility for damaged or lost shipments. Unannounced returns to our facilities will cause serious delays in any potential refunds or replacements.

**The refund reduction explained in this article only applies in the case of a normal (non-warranty) return.**

For warranty returns, please see

[Warranty](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/warranty_2288)

. Furthermore, in case there was an error on our side regarding the shipped order (e.g. wrong color, missing part/s, etc.), all shipping costs are covered by us.

# [Shipping information](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/shipping-information_2297)

### **Original Prusa MK4**

Assembled printers and printer kits are **IN STOCK!**

### **Original Prusa XL**

Update - January 31, 2024:

We bumped up our production capacity substantially, so we shortened lead times and we will manage to ship all completed XL preorders during the spring of 2024.

Orders completed **before February 29** will be placed in the shipping queue based on the date when the pre-order was made. If you decide to complete your order later, your printer will be placed in the shipping queue based on the payment date. That means you will lose your place in the preorder queue as we are going to switch the XL from a preorder product to a regular product after February 29. However, you will still get the two extra gifts described below.

After February 29, 2024, we will create the shipping schedule and send an email to all customers with the estimated shipping date. According to our current estimate (based on the previous batch of XL preorders), we expect to ship all orders completed before February 29 by the end of May 2024.

We are adding two useful gifts to all XL preorders as compensation for the delay: an extra print sheet and the Nextruder adapter for third-party nozzles.

### **Original Prusa MMU3**

**MMU3 for the MK3S+** is now **IN STOCK!**

**MMU2- >MMU3 upgrade kits for MK3S+** are now **IN STOCK!**

**MMU3 for the MK4 / MMU2- >MMU3 upgrade kits for MK4 info below:**

**Update 26th January:** Both internal and external tests with PLA are overwhelmingly positive. We have spent the last couple of weeks fine-tuning PETG, and we are also getting good results. These are the two materials the MMU3 will officially support. If you need to print other polymers, it is likely possible, but we want to clearly state that only PLA and PETG are the materials we have extensively tested and officially support.

Apart from our internal testing department, we have a team of fantastic external beta testers, who have been testing every step of the development thus far. Many changes made to the MMU3 were based on their feedback. We are now giving them the green light to start posting their experience with the MMU3, so you might start seeing pictures and videos of it online.

_MMU3 integration in Prusa Connect_

As we continue testing the MMU3 for the MK4, the Prusa Connect team has added new functionality. The MK4 can newly report to Prusa Connect if the MMU3 unit is connected. Prusa Connect is now also able to read the currently active MMU3 slot and display the information in the status bar.

_Technical updates and resolved issues_

Layer shifts - In our testing, we had problems with random layer shifts. These were quite rare, but since the print cannot be saved if the problem occurs, they were very annoying to encounter. The prints were clean with nothing the nozzle could crash into. The culprit turned out to be a bug in the firmware, occurring only when the MMU unit is connected. We believe we have fixed the problem in our latest internal firmware build. We continue to investigate the issue, to make sure the problem is completely eliminated.

Spool holders - The spool holders and filament buffer remain the only components where we are still doing significant changes. Our tests show that on the MK4, where the length of the unloaded filament is slightly longer compared to the MK3S+, filament tension in the buffer and from the spool holders impacts reliability. We are testing different setups to see which work the best.

Enhancements to printed parts - Over the last period of testing, we have made several improvements to the printed parts. We are now printing the production version of these parts, but further testing is necessary to ensure they function without causing any new issues.

Wear of the Nextruder main plate - Lastly, we are investigating wear of a part which guides the filament from the drive gears into the nozzle tube. The wear is caused by repeated loads and unloads of filament. Without the MMU, this wear is insignificant. However, a single MMU print can have thousands of filament loads and unloads, increasing the wear rate. Once this part wears out, the printer is unable to properly push filament into the nozzle. We're testing different materials and manufacturing methods for this part to maximize its lifespan while maintaining functionality. It's possible this part will be treated as a consumable, requiring replacement every few months.

We are committed to ensuring the MMU3 for the MK4 is a reliable and effective upgrade and we’re doing everything we can to begin shipping it by the end of March. Thank you for your patience.

# [Building your MINI](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/building-your-mini_6384)

- Before covering the electronics, make sure the square nut is correctly positioned in the printed part. **The nut must not fall out!** This can cause fatal damage to the electronics.

- Insert the cover back in, make sure it is properly seated in the slot. _Note: on an older design, there were holes instead of slots, the assembly procedure is the same._

-  **Place the second cover on the top and arrange the cables:**

-  **Extruder bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially in. Also, it must be tilted away from the printer.

-  **Heatbed bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially inside the box.

-  **Filament sensor cable** (optional), ensure that the textile sleeve wrapped around the cables is partially inside the box.

- Now, tighten the second cover. Check that no cable is pinched.

# [Troubleshooting the MINI/MINI+ assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/troubleshooting-the-mini-mini-assembly_7848)

In rare scenarios, it might happen that the length of the cable bundle is not distributed properly and some wires are being pulled, when the print head is in its maximum range. Let's fix that :)

- First, before you disassemble anything, let's do a final check. Rotate the lead screw until the X-axis is all the way up.

- Move the print head all the way to the right and ensure it is touching the printed part.

The print head must stay in this position on its own. If not, then the entire cable bundle above the X-axis is too short.

- To fix the cable redistribution, cut all three marked zip ties. Make an adjustment, so the print head can touch the end of the axis freely. Don't be too generous with the length of the cables above the axis, as you might overstretch the cables leading from the electronics box.

- When satisfied, reapply the zip ties and ensure the heads aren't in collision with the fan's casing.

---

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_8024)

-  **Always read all the instructions at the current step first** , it will help you to understand, what you need to do. **Don't cut or trim unless you are told to!!!**

-  **Don't follow pictures only!** It is not enough, the written instructions are as brief as they could be. Read them.

-  **Read the comments** from the other users, they are a great source of ideas. We read them too and based on your feedback, we improve the manual and the entire assembly process.

-  **Use a reasonable force** , the printed and aluminium parts are tough, but not unbreakable. If it doesn't fit, check your approach twice.

-  **Eat the gummy bears as instructed!** Disobedience won't be tolerated :D

-  **Most important: Enjoy the build, have fun**. Cooperate with your kids, friends or partners. _However, we take no responsibility for possible fights ;)_

-  **You can use your own tools** (e.g. pliers for easier screw insertion). In the case of electronic screwdriver, make sure the torque is set to low and proceed carefully.

-  **READY?**

You can start by assembling the printer in the next chapter -

[2\. Base & Tower](http://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544)

---

# [2. Base & Tower](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544)

- Before you mount the support, please take a closer look at:

- The bottom plate, which has two special grooves for the supports. The picture is showing just one, the second is on the opposite side and completely identical.

- Each support has two holes with countersink from one side, this side has to be facing outwards from the printer.

- The other side of the support is without countersink and must be facing inwards to the printer.

- All the holes are symmetrical, therefore apart from the countersink holes, you can rotate them either way.

- Take the first support and mount it to the bottom plate. Ensure the countersink holes are facing outwards, then secure the support using two M3x8 screws from the bottom.

- Check the bottom plate and support outer surfaces are aligned. If not, release the screws a little bit and readjust the support. Then tighten the screws again.

Continue in the next step...

---

# [3. Covers & Platform](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-covers-platform_10328)

- Let's start with the thermistor, **take the covercheck top** and insert the thermistor in. The cable channel is only in this top part.

- For easier assembly let's assume that the bottom side is marked with the red colour.

- Guide the cable using the channel and make sure it is entirely inside. If not, you might pinch it after adding the opposite printed part.

- About 80 % of the thermistor's tip should be outside the printed part to measure the temperature properly.

- Now, insert the lid safety switch. Insert it from the same side as the thermistor. In other words, both sensors will have cables on the same side of the printed part. Also, ensure that the cables are closer to the lower edge of the printed part.

- Finish the assembly using the second printed part. This time it is the covercheck bottom. **Ensure no wire is pinched or bent!!!**

---

# [4. Electronics & Lid](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-electronics-lid_11824)

**WARNING:**

the following procedure is crucial. Make sure you read the instructions first! The FEP film consists of three layers. Two layers are for the protection of the middle layer, which is the actual FEP film.

- Separate all layers slightly apart to recognise them:

- Semi-thick outer layer (protection)

- Thick inner layer (FEP film)

- Thin outer layer (protection)

-  **FIRST** , remove completely the **SEMI-THICK** outer layer. Make sure all the **circular holes are free** of the remains of the film.

-  **Only after** you have successfully removed the thick layer and the "circular" remains, remove the **THIN** outer layer.

- You should end up with the middle layer, which is without both outer layers. Also, double-check you have removed all the remains.

---

# [5. Preflight check](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-preflight-check_13824)

- In the following steps, we will go through the entire process of the calibration.

- Plug the printer in, ensure the PSU switch is on and press the button on the front to turn the printer on.

- Follow the instructions on the touchscreen and use this chapter to get extra information regarding each step.

**DON'T POUR THE RESIN**

in the tank until you are asked to by the printer!

**Never service the printer with the resin inside!**

- Spilling the resin inside the printer will most probably end up damaging the SL1. Be careful!

Never look inside the printer during the calibration of the screen or UV LED. There is a risk of

**PERMANENT DAMAGE**

to your eye(s).

# [How to replace a heatbreak/heaterblock/heatsink (MK3/MK2.5)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbreak-heaterblock-heatsink-mk3-mk2-5_14944)

**WARNING:**

Removing hotend from the extruder needs a "special" technique, then the hotend slides out quite easily. Don't use excessive force, or you will damage some parts irreversibly!!!

- The hotend is removed by inclining and pulling at the same time. See the first picture showing the **WRONG inclination**. This hotend is inclined too much to the front and there is no gap between the hotend and the extruder body. Hotend is partly inside and you won't be able to remove it.

- The second picture is showing the **CORRECT inclination**. The hotend is tilted, but there is a gap between the hotend and the extruder body. You will be able to remove it.

- Now, let's incline the hotend properly. Take pliers in the second hand, grab the hotend above heatsink's ribs, pull downwards and slightly towards you. The hotend should "jump" out. Make sure you don't stretch the cables too much or you might damage them.

---

# [How to replace a heatbreak/heatsink/heaterblock (MK3S+/MK3S/MK2.5S/MMU2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbreak-heatsink-heaterblock-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_16104)

Before you move any parts, make sure there is enough slack in the extruder motor cable!!!

If not, you have to cut the zip ties on the textile sleeve, open the box with electronics and make sure the motor cable is free to move.

- Carefully move the extruder apart. First, pull the motor, then the lower part with the print fan.

- Create a gap similar to the picture. Align the printed part holding the motor with the edge of the fan frame.

- Reach for the hotend and incline its upper part towards the motor, it should slide out.

If the hotend is still stuck inside, release the screws more and extend the gap between the printed parts.

-  **BE EXTRA CAUTIOUS** with the hotend cables!!! You can break them! Use a small force to pull the hotend out. Don't bend the cables.

# [How to replace a PTFE tube (MK3/MK2.5)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-ptfe-tube-mk3-mk2-5_17360)

- Now it is time to insert the new PTFE tube. Note there are two different ends.

- One end of the tube has **"rounded" outer edge**. This end must be **inside the hotend**.

- Look at the other end, where the tube is drilled inside, shape of the **edge is "conical"**. This is the side, where filament enters the tube. This part must be **outside the hotend**.

- Push the black collet in. Slide the tube all the way in and hold it!

- Using second hand pull the collet out and only then release the tube!!! **THIS IS CRUCIAL** for the hotend to work properly.

After you finish inserting the new PTFE tube, check all the parts are properly tightened and nothing got loose during the process.

# [How to import profiles to Cura 4.x (Windows & macOS)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-import-profiles-to-cura-4-x-windows-macos_17848)

- The package includes several subfolders, which must be imported (or copied) into the Cura. Note you have to use correct version of the settings!

- Folder **01_Cura_printer_definitons** includes profiles for the printers with dimensions, speeds and other parameters.

- Folder **02_Cura_printer_extruders** additional parameters for the printer, specifically for the extruder properties (new in Cura 3.5.1).

- Folder **03_Cura_meshes** includes platforms (heatbeds), which are just for the visual effect, though it is good to know, where your object will be printed on the heatbed.

- Folder **04_Cura_layerheight_profiles** includes settings for various layer heights (print quality).

- Folder **05_Cura_Prusa_materials** includes materials, which should be imported because default Cura material values differ from what is recommended for Prusa filaments.

# [How to post-process the printed parts](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-post-process-the-printed-parts_18680)

**WARNING:**

following tools can easily harm you. Make sure you read the manual from the tool manufacturer!

**ALWAYS**

use protective equipment like safety glasses and gloves.

-  **Recommended tools for this manual:**

-  **Sharp and thin cutting blade** , the best option is a scalpel, but utility knife is also possible to use.

-  **Twist drill bits, ideally with a flat head** , but those aren't easy to find. The lower the angle on the bit's head the better. For printed parts you need two sizes:

- 8.1 mm / 0.3-inch drill bit (or slightly bigger, but not smaller)

- 3 mm / 0.12-inch drill bit (or slightly bigger, but not smaller)

-  **Pliers with thin/slim jaw are the best** , you can also use the bundled ones, but you might not be able to reach certain places.

# [How to replace a heatbed thermistor (MK3S+/MK3S/MK2.5S/MK2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbed-thermistor-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mk2s_19272)

- Based on the generation of your printer you might have slightly **different protection of the cables:**

-  **Old printers** used a plastic spiral wrap with zip tie.

-  **New printers** are using a textile sleeve held by printed parts.

- Most of the time, it will be enough to remove two screws (MK3S, MK3, MK2.5S, MK2.5) or cut the zip tie (MK2S and MK2)

- Remove the textile sleeve or the spiral wrap all the way, but keep it for reassembly.

- In rare scenarios, you might have to release the entire cover, or even the power wires to get access to the thermistor wire.

- Regardless of the type of the cable management, in this step, you need to remove the wrap and get access to the entire length of the thermistor cable.

- Now, carefully remove the thermistor with both the tapes (yellow and aluminium) from the heatbed.

# [How to replace PSU on MK3 printers](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-psu-on-mk3-printers_20152)

**ATTENTION:**

proceed very carefully during this step. Use reasonable force and don't rotate the printer. We need to adjust part of the frame, which might affect the overall geometry.

The new black PSU has mounting points in a different place, we need to rotate the short extrusion by 90 °.

- Start by releasing and removing M5 screws on both sides of this extrusion. Together you need to remove 8 screws. _Note that four screws aren't visible in the picture (green arrows)._

- Carefully and gently rotate the extrusion 90 ° counter-clockwise. Point is to have the silver PSU-holders on the side (facing to the left). **AVOID removing the extrusion!!!**

- Check the silver PSU holders are now on the side (facing to the left).

- Insert all eight screws back (from both sides), but first screw them in just slightly, stop about 1 mm from the surface.

- Remove the rubber foot by turning and pulling from the side and place it from the bottom, like the rest.

- Now, start tightening all the screws. **ALWAYS tighten on a diagonal!**

# [How to replace a hotend PTFE tube (MK3S+/MK3S/MK2.5S/MMU2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-ptfe-tube-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_21664)

- Now it is time to insert the new PTFE tube. Note, that each end of the tube is different.

- One end of the tube has **"rounded" outer edge**. This end must be **inside the hotend**.

- Look at the other end, where the tube is drilled inside, the shape of the **edge is "conical"**. This is the side, where filament enters the tube. This part must be **outside the hotend**.

- Push the PTFE tube in. Slide the tube all the way in and hold it!

- Using the other hand pull the collet out and only then release the tube!!! **THIS IS CRUCIAL** for the hotend to work properly.

- After you finish inserting the new PTFE tube, check all the parts are properly tightened and nothing got loose during the process.

# [How to replace a hotend thermistor (MK2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-thermistor-mk2s_22208)

- Lay the printer on the PSU side so you have better access to the thermistor.

- Using 1.5mm Allen key release the screw on the heater block. **BE GENTLE** while unscrewing the screw or you might damage the thread!

- Use the Allen key again and carefully push the thermistor "head" upwards.

- Remove the thermistor completely.

# [Maintenance tips](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/maintenance-tips_23200)

Assuming the Z-axis is cleaned, let's move to the lubrication process. Open the tube and if needed perforate its protective cover.

- Turn the printer on and using the printer's menu (press and hold the knob button, then rotate it) move the Z-axis, all the way down. **Make sure won't damage the heatbed!**

- Apply a small drop of the lubricant on both smooth rods. Using your finger or the towel spread the paste around the diameter of each rod. _Don't apply too much of the paste, it will have the opposite effect._

- Move the Z-axis all the way up. Use again the menu.

- Apply an even smaller drop on the parts of the rods, which were previously covered with the X-ends and move the Z-axis all the way down.

- You should create a very thin layer of the lubricant on both rods, check for any significant excess of the paste and clean it, as it will catch a lot of dust over time.

**DON'T APPLY THE LUBRICANT ON THE LEADSCREWS OR TR. NUTS!!!**

That is all for the lubrication part.

- Plastic scraper (ice scraper will do fine)

- Microfibre cloth to prevent scratches to the new PEI surface

- Plastic bag bigger than the steel sheet

- Surface to work on - best is sturdy foam board, ideally at least twice the size of the steel sheet. A thin plastic sheet isn't recommended.

- Glass of clean tap water

- IPA or acetone

Get all those items in advance, it is very complicated to stop or even pause in the middle of the process.

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_24976)

**To successfully finish the assembly please follow all these:**

-  **Always read all the instructions at current step first** , it will help you to understand, what you need to do. **Don't cut or trim unless you are told to!!!**

-  **Don't follow pictures only!** It is not enough, the written instructions are as brief as they could be. Read them.

-  **Read the comments** from the other users, they are great source of ideas. We read them too and based on your feedback improve the manual and the entire assembly.

-  **Use a reasonable force** , the printed parts are tough, but not unbreakable. If it doesn't fit, check your approach twice.

-  **Eat the gummy bears as instructed!** Disobedience won't be tolerated :D

-  **Most important: Enjoy the build, have fun**. Cooperate with your kids, friends or partners. _However, we take no responsibility for possible fights ;)_

# [2. Y-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-y-axis-assembly_25488)

Note this step is optional for now.

**We recommend mounting the feet now to protect the surface on your table**

(workbench). However, you need to lift the frame up before each turn.

There will be extra step at the end of the assembly to remind you of the antivibration feet.

Note there are two designs of the feet, your package will have either the new version (marked orange) or the old version (marked red).

-  **For this step, please prepare:**

- New antivibration foot (4x)

- Old antivibration foot (4x)

- Turn the YZ frame on the side and insert the antivibration foot. **For the new design** , insert and turn 90 degrees to lock it in place. **For the old design** insert inclined, then rotate the foot until you squish the rim inside the extrusion.

- Repeat this process on all 4 feet. Place them 2-3 cm from the end of each extrusion.

---

# [3. X-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-x-axis-assembly_27464)

**ATTENTION:**

be very careful during the tightening, check the nut orientation and

**DO NOT**

use excessive force, you can break this part.

- Insert the M3nN nyloc nut in the X-end-idler.

In case you can't press the nut in,

**don't use excessive force**

. Leave the nut for now and proceed with the other components for this step.

- Insert the 623h bearing into the X-end idler.

- Secure it in place using an M3x18 screw.

Now, if needed, use the M3 screw to pull the nut in.

- Place your finger on the bearing and ensure it can rotate freely. If needed adjust the screw.

---

# [4. Z-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-z-axis-assembly_27976)

-  **Aside from the X-axis, please prepare for the following step:**

- Smooth rod 320 mm (2x)

**WARNING:**

be very careful while installing the X-axis on the trapezoidal lead screws. The process should be smooth,

**otherwise you might damage the thread**

inside the plastic nut. Reseat the axis if necessary.

- Carefully slide the X-axis on the trapezoidal lead screws. By rotating both screws simultaneously let the X-axis slide until both trapezoidal lead screws are visible. If you feel any significant resistance, try to reseat the axis first.

- Make sure the top smooth rod of the X-axis and the lower edge of the frame are parallel.

-  **NOW, PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL!** Gently insert **the remaining smooth rods** through the bearings on the X-axis all the way down into printed parts, do not apply too much force and do not tilt the rod!

In case you manage to push out balls from the bearings, please count them. One or two balls are ok, if there are more of them, please consider ordering new bearings.

Note: Design of your X-end printed parts might slightly differ, but the assembly process is the same.

---

# [5. E-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_28536)

In this step, we will finish tensioning the belt. Please read the instructions first, your belt might have proper tension already, then there is no need for additional screw adjustment.

- First, slightly release all the screws holding the motor, otherwise, the upper "tensioner" won't work (the motor must be able to move).

**ATTENTION !!! BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHILE TIGHTENING, YOU CAN CRACK THE PART IF YOU OVER TIGHT THE SCREW.**

- Using Allen key start tightening the M3x18 screw inside the X-end-motor, but after each turn or two check the tension in the belt.

- For the optimal performance, the belt must be a bit harder to press with your fingers. Move the extruder all the way to the X-end-idler and try the belt tension in the middle of the X-axis.

- When you achieve optimal tension, please tighten the screws again.

In case you experience X-axis failure during calibration or skipped layers in the X direction, you can adjust this screw accordingly. Tightening the screw stretches the belt. Releasing the screw has opposite effect. Each time don't forget to release the screws on the motor first.

# [8. Electronics assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-electronics-assembly_34416)

**IMPORTANT**

: it is

**CRUCIAL**

to connect the PSU and HB cables in correct order to the EINSY board.

**POSITIVE WIRE**

must be connected to

**POSITIVE SLOT**

. There are

**TWO VERSIONS**

of the cables with different coloring system:

-  **Version A** : both wires on each pair are black, **POSITIVE WIRE** is marked with a **RED LINE**

-  **Version B** : on each pair, there is a red and black wire. **POSITIVE WIRE** is **FULLY RED**.

- Connect wires from PSU and HEATBED to the EINSY board in the following order (red arrows indicate positive slot):

- The first cable from the PSU (A+|A-).

- The second cable from the PSU (B+|B-).

- Cable from the heatbed (C+|C-).

Both cables (two pairs) from the PSU are the same, their order doesn't matter, just ensure correct polarity.

# [2B. MK3S/MK2.5S extruder disassembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2b-mk3s-mk2-5s-extruder-disassembly_38120)

MK3S and MK3S MMU2S extruders are very similar, we need just to change few parts, but we have to release the cable bundle.

We need to gently pull the IR filament sensor cable back to the extruder as the sensor will be in a different position. Make sure the entire path of the cable is free. However there is no need for complete disassembly.

- Using an Allen key release the M3x40 screw and open the door.

- Release two M3x10 screws and remove the extruder-cable-clip. On older printers cut the zip tie.

- In case there are zip ties inside the Einsy-case, carefully remove them.

- Remove the zip ties on the cable holder.

- Keep the textile sleeve on the cables, but make sure the cable can slip inside. It might be twisted around other cables, in such case, you have to remove the sleeve.

**Carefully and quietly**

open the bag with the Haribo sweets. High level of

**noise might attract nearby predators!**

- Sort the bears into six rows according to the following scheme (colours might differ):

-  **Previous and current chapter** were very difficult, at least **25 % of total amount is needed**.

-  **Idler assembly** is quite easy, **10 %** is enough.

-  **Pulley body assembly** requires your attention, eat no less than **20 %** of all bears.

-  **Electronics assembly** is the last chapter with high level of difficulty, consume **25 %**.

-  **Spool holders with the buffer** are easy to make, research shows that **10 %** is enough.

-  **Preflight calibration and the first flight** are almost effortless. Experienced user will require no more than **10 %**.

# [4. Idler body assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-idler-body-assembly_42472)

**WARNING:**

read the instructions carefully, you have to

**assemble bearings in the correct order**

, otherwise you will encounter problems later!

- Take the first bearing and place it in the middle of the idler. Insert the shaft as in the picture, make sure you are using the opening on the top.

- Slide the shaft in using 2.5 mm Allen key. **Make sure the shaft is all the way in** and not blocking other slots for bearings.

- Take the second bearing with the shaft and assemble it in the same way as the previous one.

- Take the third bearing with the shaft and place it in the idler.

- Make final a check, ensure all three bearings can rotate freely.

- There are small openings on both sides of the idler, which can be used to push the shaft back.

---

# [5. Pulley body assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-pulley-body-assembly_43152)

- Insert the 625 bearing in the pulley-body. At the end the bearing should "snap" to the opening in the printed part.

---

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_47872)

- 3D printed parts are very precise, however, there still might be a tolerance in the printed part and same goes for the size of the nut.

- Therefore it might happen, that the nut won't fit easily in or might be falling out. Let's see, how to fix it:

-  **Nut won't fit in:** use a screw with a thread along its entire length (typically: M3x10, M3x18) and screw it from the opposite side of the opening. While tightening the screw, the nut will be pulled in. Remove the screw afterwards.

-  **Nut keeps falling out:** Use a piece of tape to fix the nut temporarily in place, as soon as you insert the screw in, you can remove the tape. _Using glue isn't recommended as it can partly reach into the thread and you won't be able to tighten the screw properly._

- Every time we recommend to use the "screw pulling technique", you will be reminded with Joe's avatar ;)

Parts in the pictures are used as an example.

---

# [2. Disassembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-disassembly_48312)

- Using a 2.5mm Allen key, release all three indicated screws on the Front print fan and fan nozzle. Don't try to remove the fan completely yet, you will need to release P.I.N.D.A. probe first.

- Using a 2.5mm Allen key release the 4 screws on the Left hotend fan. You can remove this fan completely. It will be replaced by a new one.

- Using a 2.5mm Allen key release the P.I.N.D.A. probe. Push it or screw it upwards and remove it completely. It will be replaced by a new one.

- Now, take away the Front print fan and keep it for the reassembly.

- Using a 2.5mm Allen key, remove the screws holding the Extruder idler.

- Using a 2.5mm Allen key, remove screws holding Extruder motor. Keep the motor for later use, but remove the pulley, which will be replaced.

All printed parts from the Extruder will be replaced by new ones.

# [3. E-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-e-axis-assembly_48816)

**In order to protect the hotend cables and ensure proper orientation**

, it is highly recommended to use a box. Use the one provided in the kit.

- Place the Extruder-body with the hotend on the box and make sure the cables are pointing down.

- Place your finger temporarily on the longer magnet and place the extruder motor assembly on the Extruder-body. The Bondtech gear might pull the magnet out while assembling parts together.

- Make sure both parts are aligned.

- Place the Extruder-cover on the Extruder-body. Again, make sure parts are properly aligned.

- Insert two M3x40 screws, you've prepared earlier. Tighten them, but be careful, they are slightly longer, than the thickness of the entire assembly.

Place the extruder aside for few steps, we need to prepare another part. Leave it on the box to prevent damaging the cables.

- Repeat this procedure for the second (red) wire.

---

# [5. Electronics](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-electronics_52680)

- In order to match the wrapping style of the printer, an extra textile sleeve is included for the X-axis motor cable. You can remove the spiral wrap and replace it with the textile sleeve, or leave the wrap in place. **It is up to you, this step is optional ;)**

-  **For the following step, please prepare:**

- Textile sleeve 6 x 300 mm (1x)

- Zip tie (1x)

- Wrap the sleeve around the X-axis motor and endstop cable. The sleeve is shorter, than both cables.

- Secure the sleeve using a zip tie, you have to tighten the zip tie firmly and it is only a temporary fix until the Einsy case is assembled, but you can leave the zip tie in place afterwards.

Note the rest of this chapter was photographed with the spiral wrap, but the assembly procedures are the same for the textile sleeve.

---

# [6. Preflight check](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-preflight-check_53592)

- Look at the other end, where the tube is drilled inside, shape of the **edge is "conical"**. This is the side, where filament enters the tube. This part must be **outside the hotend**.

- Push the black collet in. Slide the tube all the way in and hold it!

- Using second hand pull the collet out and only then release the tube!!! **THIS IS CRUCIAL** for the hotend to work properly. **The tube must not be able to move in or out!**

# [3. E-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-e-axis-assembly_59936)

**In order to protect the hotend cables and ensure proper orientation**

, it is highly recommended to use a box. Use the one provided in the kit.

- Place the Extruder-body with the hotend on the box and make sure the cables are pointing down.

- Place your finger temporarily on the longer magnet and place the extruder motor assembly on the Extruder-body. The Bondtech gear might pull the magnet out while assembling parts together.

- Make sure both parts are aligned.

- Place the Extruder-cover on the Extruder-body. Again, make sure parts are properly aligned.

- Insert two M3x40 screws, you've prepared earlier. Tighten them, but be careful, they are slightly longer, than the thickness of the entire assembly.

Place the extruder aside for few steps, we need to prepare another part. Leave it on the box to prevent damaging the cables.

# [4. Electronics assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-electronics-assembly_62856)

- Connect the cables from the extruder to the RAMBo board:

- P.I.N.D.A. probe (v-cable, 4 wires)

- Left hotend fan (v-cable, 3 wires)

- Extruder motor (yellow label with "E")

- Extruder heater

- Extruder thermistor (yellow/green heat shrink, orientation does not matter)

- Front print fan (red heat shrink, ensure that the red wire is closer to the extruder thermistor connector)

- Filament sensor cable (use the correct row of pins in the connector and ensure the red and blue wires are facing the outside of the board) _In the third picture, the RAMBo board is facing with the USB port towards you._

---

# [5. Preflight check](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-preflight-check_63088)

- Move the extruder to the centre of the X-axis.

- Take a zip tie from the package and place it under the P.I.N.D.A. sensor. Use the middle part of the zip tie, not the tip.

- Release the screw holding the P.I.N.D.A. sensor and gently press it against the zip tie.

- Tighten the screw on the P.I.N.D.A. holder again. **Proceed carefully as you might break the holder!**

!!!

**DO NOT use glue to fix P.I.N.D.A. probe**

in the new type of holder with the M3 screw, you won't be able to release it again !!!

- A correct height of the P.I.N.D.A. sensor compared to the nozzle should be similar to the last picture.

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_63488)

- Welcome to the tutorial how to upgrade your Original Prusa i3 **MK2/S** to Original Prusa i3 **MK3S**. Please prepare the upgrade kit received from Prusa Research. Your package includes one orange and black PETG spool or two black spools. This depends on your previous order.

- The upgrade kit does not include all the parts needed to build MK3S, therefore we must disassemble following from the MK2/S:

- All motors (Y-axis, X-axis, Z-axis and Extruder) and trapezoidal nuts

- Motor pulleys (2x)

- 623h bearing housing (2x)

- LCD screen, front cover and knob (supports will be different)

---

# [2. Disassembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-disassembly_63744)

- Using pliers, take the belt out from X-carriage.

- Before you remove the motor, unwrap the spiral wrap all the way.

- Release marked screws on the motor holder with a 2.5mm Allen key and remove the motor from the X-end-motor printed part.

- Keep the pulley on the X-axis motor.

- Move to the other side of the X-axis, release the M3 screw and take away the 623h bearing housing, keep it for later use.

- Remove black trapezoidal nuts from both x-end-motor and x-end-idler parts. Keep them for the reassembly.

---

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_64344)

**DON'T RUSH !!!**

Make sure you have all the parts before you start disassembling your printer!

- The upgrade kit MK2 -> MK2.5S **does not include all printed parts** , you have to print some them on your own! However, as a courtesy the MMU2S upgrade includes **all the parts for the MK2.5S extruder**. No need to print them ;)

- In case you use your own filament, make sure the extruder parts (FS-lever) are printed in black.

-  **Always read the instructions first** before you proceed, most issues with the assembly are caused by not following them.

---

# [2. MMU1 disassembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-mmu1-disassembly_64520)

- Take the first extruder and release all eight M3 screws.

- Remove the printed part from the motors.

**BEFORE YOU PROCEED READ THIS!**

We are about to release the lock screw on the pulley. Proceed with extreme caution as

**you can strip the screw!!!**

If possible apply some grease first.

-  **Very carefully release the lock screws** , be careful as you might strip the screw's head or thread.

- Remove the pulleys and put them away, so you won't mix them with the new ones from the MMU2S kit.

- Repeat this procedure for the second extruder. **Together you need 3 motors without the pulley.**

- Use one motor in the MK2.5S assembly for the Extruder.

- Use the remaining two motors for the MMU2S unit.

---

# [3. Upgrading to MK2/S and MK2.5S](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-upgrading-to-mk2-s-and-mk2-5s_64832)

- In case you are still rocking the Original Prusa i3 MK2, **we strongly advise upgrading to the MK2S**.

- You don't have to follow the entire MK2 to MK2S assembly, as some chapters will be repeated in MK2.5S assembly with new parts, but consider following:

-  **MK2S** swapped zip ties for U-bolts to further improve the rigidity of the heatbed assembly. This will greatly reduce vibrations and possible artefacts in the printed objects.

---

# [4. Upgrading to MMU2S](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-upgrading-to-mmu2s_65000)

-  **What is missing or is different in the MMU1 to MMU2S upgrade kit:**

- The kit doesn't include all motors. To be exact for the MMU2S unit you need to have 2 motors, which we already have disassembled from the MMU1. _(Note the third motor in the picture was used to build MK2.5S extruder)_

- One disassembled motor will be used during the idler-body assembly. There is a note to remind you :)

- The other motor will be used as a "pulley motor" for the MMU2S unit and needs extra assembly, which is covered in the MMU2S assembly manual.

---

# [Manual changelog MMU1-MMU2S](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/manual-changelog-mmu1-mmu2s_65112)

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_65152)

- Lost in the instructions, missing screw or cracked printed part? **Let us know!**

- You can contact us using following channels:

- Using comments under each step.

---

# [2. Y-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-y-axis-assembly_65392)

This is

**VERY IMPORTANT**

part of the assembly, which can significantly influence printer's behaviour.

**PLEASE**

read following lines carefully!

- Place the Y-carriage on a flat surface. Orientation doesn't matter.

- Insert linear bearing in the cutout and secure it by U-bolt.

- Hold thumb on the U-bolt and turn the carriage. Place nyloc nuts on both ends of the U-bolt.

- Start tightening the nuts, **BUT ENSURE** you are tightening both nuts equally and **AS SOON AS EACH NUT REACHES THE SURFACE OF THE Y-CARRIAGE STOP TIGHTENING!!!** We will finish tightening the nuts in the next step.

- Repeat these steps for the remaining two linear bearings.

Over tightening nuts leads to deformation of the bearing and all the issues connected with it. Please follow the instructions.

---

# [3. X-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-x-axis-assembly_67064)

Check your X-end-motor printed part for following holes. If they are present, please follow this step, otherwise skip to the next one.

- You can also check the version of the printed X-end-motor, this step is valid for B6 and higher.

- Please prepare following:

- M3nS nut (1x)

- M3x18 screw (1x)

- Insert nut and screw in the holes. For now, we need the screw just to hold in place. Tighten the screw, until its head almost reaches the surface of the printed part. We will adjust the final position later.

- Make sure the M3x18 screw is not visible in the marked hole (see the last picture) as it will block other screw in future step. If you can see the screw in the hole now, please release it slightly.

---

# [4. Z-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-z-axis-assembly_67704)

In this step, we will finish tensioning the belt. Please read the instructions first, your belt might have proper tension already.

- First, slightly release all the screws holding the motor, otherwise, the upper "tensioner" won't work (the motor must be able to move).

**ATTENTION !!! BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHILE TIGHTENING, YOU CAN CRACK THE PART IF YOU OVERTIGHT THE SCREW.**

- Using Allen key start tightening the M3x18 screw inside the X-end-motor, but after each turn or two check the tension in the belt.

- In **Step 14,** you were asked to have the belt a bit less stretched, however, for the optimal performance, the belt must be a bit harder to press with your fingers. Move the X-carriage all the way to the X-end-idler and try the belt tension in the middle of the X-axis.

- When you achieve optimal tension, please tighten the screws again.

In case you experience X-axis failure during calibration or skipped layers in the X direction, you can adjust this screw accordingly. Tightening the screw stretches the belt. Releasing the screw has opposite effect. Each time don't forget to release the screws on the motor first.

If you're experiencing troubles with getting nuts into correct places, just follow these simple steps.

- Screw M3 nut a bit on some long screw (M3x40 from Extruder bag works in most cases).

- Push the screw with the nut into the hole where it is supposed to be.

- Grab the screw with pliers and gently hammer the nut in place using a wrench.

If you use a screw from a different bag then you are using at the moment, don't forget to return it back into the bag.

---

# [2. Y-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-y-axis-assembly_79992)

Use M10n nuts (14 pcs) , M10w washers (12 pcs) and M10 threaded rods (2 pcs).

- Screw the nuts on and place washers, Y-corners and PSU-Y-part on the threaded rod as shown in the picture.

Ensure 100mm distance between a washer after counter-nut and the Y-axis corner. Use photo as reference.

- The 2 nuts have to be tightened against each other (counter-nut).

- Note that there is no gap between parts, they have to fit together.

For the initial position of Y-corners, you can temporarily mount the rods (see step 10, 11).

---

# [3. X-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-x-axis-assembly_81536)

- Insert LM8UU linear bearing into the printed parts (X-end-motor and X-end-idler) as shown in the pictures.

- The bearing should be in line with the X-ends as highlighted in the picture.

You can press on the flat surface for easier insertion.

Place two bearings in a way that the inner balls of the second bearing are rotated 45° compared to the first. This way you will achieve greater contact with the smooth rod. See third picture for more details.

---

# [4. Z-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-z-axis-assembly_82136)

- Place parts on the frame as shown in the picture.

- Use 2.5mm Allen key to tighten the parts to the frame.

Tighten them gently, no superhuman force required.

Note: If you have troubles tightening the screws, try to place them from the other side of the frame to clean the thread. Then place them again from the previous side. Proceed with caution, or you might break the screw.

---

# [5. Extruder Assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-extruder-assembly_82960)

- Mount P.I.N.D.A. probe in place.

- Secure P.I.N.D.A. probe with nut.

Exact position of P.I.N.D.A. probe will be adjusted later (during the printer calibration described in 3D Printing Handbook), so there is no need to adjust or tighten fully at this point.

- The best position for mounting at this point is to align the end of the probe with the end of the hook on the extruder body.

Note the loop on cable from probe, it's necessary to do it like that!

---

# [6. LCD assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-lcd-assembly_84176)

- Prepare the LCD controller and LCD-support printed parts as shown in the picture.

Ensure the correct orientation of parts and the LCD controller.

- Slide the LCD-support parts on the LCD-controller.

The exact position will be adjusted in the next step, no need to worry at this moment.

You can now remove the protective foil from the LCD panel.

Cables are plugged to the LCD from the factory, but you can disconnect them.

---

# [7. PSU & Heatbed assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/7-psu-heatbed-assembly_84528)

- Take a look on the printer from the top side and make sure that lines on heatbed are perfectly parallel with the X axis rods as shown in the picture.

- If they are not in parallel position, use 17 mm wrench to adjust the M10 nuts to get it correct. Use nuts only on the side close to left Z axis motor.

This is extremely important, if the things are not in parallel, you'll have huge troubles calibrating later on!

If you'll adjust the nuts, make sure that the M10 threaded rod is all the way down in the slot.

---

# [8. Electronics assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-electronics-assembly_85104)

- Extruder thermistor (cable going from the extruder labeled with Yellow/Green heat shrink) [Orientation does not matter]

# [Filament jam (MMU2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/filament-jam-mmu2s_85936)

- Start with releasing the Festo fitting on the Selector. Note it might be tightened, use 8mm wrench or pliers to release it.

- Move the orange PFTE tube slightly up

- Move the filament out from the orange PTFE tube

- It might happen you won't be able to remove the filament from the tube, proceed to the other end of the tube, **release the Festo fitting** on the extruder and if needed remove the **filament sensor cover** and open the **extruder idler**.

In case the filament get's stuck inside the MMU unit, use the

**left black button**

on the unit. To

**load or unload**

the filament.

_(If the printer is at loading stage the button works in loading mode, if the printer is at unloading stage, the button is in unloading mode)_

.

- If the "Left button" doesn't load the filament, it is possible the filament is only in the white PTFE tube (has fallen out from the MMU idler). Using your fingers, push the filament in.

# [Service menu - Individual Filament Calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/service-menu-individual-filament-calibration_86376)

- Open the idler on the extruder (release the M3 screws with springs on the other side). Using buttons move the filament until reaching the Bondtech gear **Left button is down, Right is up.**

To reach the optimal position, move the filament down, up then down again to the desired position. This will calibrate the length and also release tension in the filament.

-  **Correct alignment** is slightly above the middle of the gear (the filament is slightly "touching" the teeth on the Bondtech).

-  **Incorrect alignment** (the second and third picture)

- After you finish the alignment, press the **middle button** for 1-2 seconds on the MMU2 unit. The filament will unload and this will save the filament position (length).

**To ensure the length was set properly**

, press the

**middle button**

again to load the filament back to the extruder.

-  **Is the tip of the filament in the previously saved position?** (tolerance +/-1 mm) Great, press the middle button again to unload the filament and go to the next step.

-  **Is the filament loaded to a different position?** Adjust it again using the left/right button. Unload, reload and check. Repeat this until the filament returns to the same position (tolerance +/-1 mm). Then proceed to the next step.

# [How to trim PTFE tube - Multi Material](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-trim-ptfe-tube-multi-material_108480)

-

This guide is dedicated to the PTFE tubes for Multi Material Original Prusa printers.

**PTFE tube specifications are listed below.**

All the required tubes come with the current products already cut to size. For replacements, visit the [Prusa E-shop](https://www.prusa3d.com/cs/).

However, if you need to make your own PTFE tubing, make sure to read the following guide carefully.

- For trimming, get a cutting tool with a thin blade. Use either razor or carpet knife. **DON'T** use a kitchen knife.

- For chamfering, we recommend to use a specific drill bit with appropriately angled conical head.

- Using the chamfering drill bit, we recommend using it by hand. If you use an electric drill, set it to low speed and press very gently.

# [Nozzle crashed into the heatbed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/nozzle-crashed-into-the-heatbed_112003)

If this occurs it indicates a problem with the P.I.N.D.A. or SuperPINDA sensor. P.I.N.D.A. stands for Prusa INDuction Auto leveling. It is the Z-axis end-stop on the MK2/S and MK3/S. It accurately detects metal within a certain range, so if the nozzle crashes into the bed the P.I.N.D.A. is either adjusted too high in relation to the nozzle, or the sensor itself or its cable may be faulty.

A faulty or maladjusted P.I.N.D.A. can also cause issues during mesh bed-leveling and/or XYZ calibration.

### Testing the P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor

If the P.I.N.D.A. sensor, or more commonly any of its wires, is damaged there can be multiple different leveling issues. Please see [P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA Sensor testing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/p-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing_2091) for more information.

#### Lowering the PINDA

The P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA holder is closed by a screw marked by the purple arrow in the picture below. In order to change the height of the sensor, open this screw.

Lower the P.I.N.D.A. sensor by 1-2 threads, or redo the [_pre-flight check_](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/9-preflight-check_176167) _,_ where you use the thin tip of the zip-tie instead of the thicker center which is instructed (circled in green in the picture below).

Make sure to tighten the holder screw after adjusting the height.

# [Clogged nozzle/hotend (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mini-mini_112011)

A clogged nozzle or hotend is a common issue for the FFF/FDM printers. If there are no issues, the filament is pushed in the hotend, melted, and then extruded through the nozzle. However, if the PTFE tube is damaged (scarred, distorted) or there are impurities in the filament it might get stuck in the hotend, clogging the printer.

### How to spot clogged nozzle/hotend?

#### Visual check

* Is the filament reaching the nozzle? Check the long Bowden PTFE tube.
* Is the filament coming out of the nozzle? Pay attention when loading filament.
* Partial clog - gaps and missing layers
* Partial clog - filament curling up and sticking to the nozzle


* Clicking noise from the extruder



_Missing layers can be a sign of a partially clogged nozzle_

#### Partial clog

Sometimes the clog is partial, meaning that the printer is able to push some filament through, but it is not enough to print the object properly, leading to **visible gaps and missing layers**. An early sign of a clogged nozzle is that the filament is not extruded consistently, curls up, and sticks to the nozzle.

#### Extruder clicking

The hotend or the nozzle is partially or fully clogged and the internal resistance against the flow of the filament is greater than what the gears are able to push. As a result, the gears are skipping leading to the **“clicking” noise** and in most scenarios also to grinding of the filament.

It is important to note, that the clogs can happen in multiple places across the filament path and each requires a slightly different approach. For example, changing the nozzle, while the clogs are happening due to the damaged PTFE tube, won’t solve the issue.

### How to fix the clogged printer?

Choosing the right method depends on whether **you are able to at least partially load/unload the filament or the printer is fully jammed** and refusing the move the filament even a little.

Before you start fixing the printer, try unloading the filament and removing it completely. If you are unable to do it, it might indicate a more serious problem, but we will deal with this one as well.

Also, move the print head up from _**LCD Menu - Settings - Move Axis - Z-axis**_ or by long-pressing the control knob, this way you will get better access to the parts, which are clogged.

#### Extruder idler screw

The idler screw is located right below the PTFE tube where you load the filament (left picture). This adjusts the pressure of the filament onto the filament pulley.

If you find that the extruder filament pulley is full of plastic residue, the idler screw may have been adjusted too tight. It can be adjusted with the 2.5 mm Allen key. **The head of the screw should be flush to just within the printed plastic part of the extruder** when the filament is not loaded.

_The idler screw should be about flush with the plastic part, when the filament is NOT loaded._

#### Cold pull (load/unload possible)

If you are able to load and unload the filament, yet still experiencing partial clogs, try this technique first, which uses a partly melted filament to pick up the debris inside the hotend and pull it out. We have prepared a detailed article about [Cold pull (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mini_126399).

Once you finish, head to the point in this article to learn how to check for a dirty Extruder pulley.

#### Forcing the clog out (load impossible)

Sometimes the gears are not able to push the filament through, but it doesn’t mean that you need to immediately start with the disassembly. By raising the temperature further above the melting point, you might be able to remove the clog together with the debris.

1. Go to LCD Menu - Settings - Temperature - Nozzle and raise the temperature about 40-50 °C above the normal print temperature (for PLA use 260 °C, for PETG use 280 °C).
2. After the nozzle reaches the required temperature, wait for about 2-3 minutes - the filament should fully melt and start dripping out.
3. Use the bundled acupuncture needle (0.3 mm) and push it in the nozzle from below. Push it in and out several times, in multiple directions. Then remove it and try loading the filament again.
4. If the needle didn’t help, remove the Bowden PTFE from the print head and push the filament in manually. Don’t forget to hold the end of the X-axis with the other hand, or you might skew the axis.
5. If the filament clog happened with PLA, you can try loading a material that melts at a higher temperature, such as ASA, ABS, PC.
6. The last resort is a rigid metal wire (1.5 mm diameter, 100 mm length). Insert it from the top instead of the filament. Push it down, through the hotend, but be careful and gentle. You might accidentally scratch the PTFE tube.
7. Once ready with the clog, head to the last chapter, check for dirty Extruder pulley
8. If you are unable to push the filament nor the wire through, you have to disassemble the hotend and find the place, where the filament is stuck. See the next method.



### Disassembling the hotend

#### (load/unload impossible)

Some clogs can’t be removed easily and require you to partially disassemble the hotend. The filament is either stuck in the PTFE tube or in the nozzle. The filament can also be stuck due to a damaged or worn-out PTFE tube. If this is your case, we recommend [replacing the PTFE tube for a new one.](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-ptfe-tube-mini-mini_119449) For disassembly and an inspection, we have outlined the procedure below.

1. Remove the Bowden tube coming from the extruder and the brass fitting securing the PTFE tube using your 10 mm wrench. _If the nozzle is heated up you will now be able to pull out any filament together with the Bowden tube._


2. Carefully pull out the old PTFE tube from the heatsink using pliers or tweezers.


3. Investigate the PTFE tube. Check the PTFE tube for possible damage, and if needed, [replace it for a new one.](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-ptfe-tube-mini-mini_119449) _A spare PTFE is included with the printer._
4. Clean any remains of filament from the hotend. The bottom of the heat break should be clean and shiny. _You can remove any filament by doing a cold pull without the PTFE tube installed._


5. Insert the PTFE tube back into the heatbreak again. Loosen the three set screws on the side of the heatsink with a 1.5 mm Allen wrench.


6. Screw the brass fitting into the top of the heatsink all the way in, then loosen it by a full turn (360 °). The side with the **fewest threads goes into the heatsink** (purple arrows and lines). __We will compress the PTFE tube in the next step to ensure proper operation. If you have done this already with the same PTFE tube before, you might need to replace the PTFE tube with a new one.__

In some scenarios, it might be enough to clean up the hotend, reseat the PTFE, and tighten the fitting properly to fix clogs.




_Orientation of brass fittings._ _The end with the least threads into the heatsink._

7. Press the heater block upwards with a reasonable force. While maintaining the slight upwards pressure on it, tighten up the three set screws on the side of the heatsink.
8. Then tighten the fitting on top of the heat sink completely (a full turn), which will compress the hotend PTFE tube.



Make sure the nozzle and heater block are cold before touching them!

You can now reattach the Bowden tube that leads to the extruder. Before testing the printer we recommend checking the last two points below.

### After fixing the clog

#### First layer calibration

After doing maintenance on the print head we recommend doing a new First layer calibration, as hardware can slightly shift during the procedure. For more info, please see [First Layer Calibration (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364).

#### Cleaning the extruder pulley

All the issues mentioned above can participate in the filament being ground between the pulley and the bearing. Once the teeth on the pulley get full of filament debris, the extruder won’t be able to load the filament properly.

You can either use the inspection door (see the picture below) to check whether the pulley is clean. Use compressed air to get rid of the dust, for a more thorough cleaning, follow this guide [How to access and clean the extruder-pulley (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-access-and-clean-the-extruder-pulley-mini-mini_126457).

_Use the inspection door to check the pulley_

# [External SPI flash W25X20CL/xFLASH not responding - error](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/external-spi-flash-w25x20cl-xflash-not-responding-error_112019)

This occurs on some boards and its cause can be somewhat elusive. The W25X20CL is a memory chip on the Einsy Rambo board. It is an issue when flashing the firmware and is normally caused by the following:

With firmware version 3.10.0 the error message was updated to include other chips than the "W25X20CL", under the common name of "XFLASH".

Do not plug or unplug cables while the printer is on and the mainboard is powered, especially the MMU2S signal cable and the IR filament sensor cable.

#### Issue with the LCD-module

A poor connection to the LCD module or a faulty LCD module can generate issues when flashing the firmware.

Try to flash the firmware again with the LCD module disconnected or its cables re-seated.

#### Custom Firmware

Contact your developers of the firmware and check if anyone else has had the issue. We, unfortunately, can not provide support for custom firmware and modifications.

#### Old revision of the Einsy Rambo-board.

With more and more languages being supported in the Firmware, some older boards do not have the capacity to store all the languages included. You can get this error on the Einsy Rambo rev.10.a without a daughter-board plugged into the LCD ports. In this case, you will still be able to use the firmware fully but only with English language. The daughterboard is no longer offered, therefore if the board itself is found to be the problem, it needs to be replaced.

#### Faulty Einsy Rambo

Like all electronics, it can fail, so if the points above do not provide any insight into your issue, please contact customer support to resolve it.

If we have sent you some replacement parts before, don't forget to also send us back the original (broken) parts too.

### Return for repair

When returning the printer just for repair, you do not have to include everything. You can keep the tools (pliers, spatula, screwdriver, Allen key, spanner, cables, etc).

We do need you to send us the resin giving you issues (the whole bottle, not just a sample), and the USB flash drive with the "G-code" that you had trouble printing. Please, also include a copy of the original STL-file.

Always include the Prusa Service list, filled out with your order number, serial number, and summary of what went wrong, so that we know what we should focus on. All this will help us to get the printer back to you much faster.

### Packing materials

**Before you start packing it down, get out your phone or camera to take pictures of the printer before and during the packing process. Make sure the[serial number sticker is present on the back of the printer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/original-prusa-serial-number_134171#original-prusa-sl1). If it is not present, please [contact support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) right away.**

If you bought the printer assembled, please re-use the box and padding in which you received it. If it was a kit, it uses the same box but is missing the special padding. If you have discarded the box, here are some measurements to acquire a new one:

* The assembled printer's dimensions are roughly 220 x 240 x 410 mm / 8,6 x 9.4 x 16.1 in
* **Box should be at least 300 x 320 x 500 mm / 11.8 x 12.6 x 19.6 in.**
* The original printer's box is 500 x 450 x 320 mm / 19.6 x 17.7 x 12.6 in.



You will need a piece of bubble-wrap/sheet padding. Roughly 400 × 400 mm / 15 × 15 in. **Do not use packing peanuts and/or shredded paper as padding material!** This is not suitable. Use crumpled paper, bubble-wrap, or other inflated packing material.

### Packing process

1. Remove the resin-tank (vat) and lay a layer of thin cardboard on top of the print-LCD. Make holes in the cardboard at the screw-holes and secure the vat on top with its screws. _To easily get the correct holes, place the tank with screws on top of the cardboard and press the screws down to mark where you create some holes (left picture)._



Cardboard from a box of rubber-gloves or tissues is ideal.

2. Remove the build-platform and push the tower halfway down its axis and secure the platform-mount by securing the knob and cantilever screws, as in the last step of the calibration-procedure.


3. Wrap the build-plate up in several layers of bubble-wrap and place it inside the resin tank.
4. Cut out another piece of cardboard and place it on top of the tank with the platform and tape it down (green arrows). Then push the lever down until it touches the cardboard (yellow arrow).


5. Fill the remaining space with bubble-wrap or other packing material and close the orange lid of the printer.
6. Secure the cover with kitchen cling-film (plastic foil) 2-3 times around the whole printer.



If you still have the original box and padding, please use this to pack down the printer. **Packing the CW1 is the same process, only tape the rotation-platform so it does not spin around in transit** , then wrap accessories and place them in the tank, before wrapping this up and placing it in its place. Then run plastic foil (cling-film) around the machine.

7. To secure the printer itself in the box, apply 5-8 cm (2-3 in) of padding to the bottom of the box, place the machine in the center.
8. Pack additional material/accessories in a separate box, or in padding material and place it next to the printer.
9. Fill the remaining empty space inside the box with bubble wrap, inflatable air cushions, or similar soft packaging material.


10. Wrap the whole box up in a few layers of plastic film for additional protection and print the ['Fragile' picture linked here](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fragile.pdf) and tape it to the outside, with the arrows pointing to the top of the box.



Document your packing procedures in case of damage during transit.

# [Spool placement](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/spool-placement_112035)

Where your spools are located can make the difference between trouble and smooth operation of the printer. It is also often desirable to reduce the footprint of the printer as much as possible. Here are some pointers to where it is best to keep the spool and its holders according to our experience.

### MK2/S, MK2.5S, and MK3S/+:

The ideal location of the spool for the MK2/S and MK3/S is using the supplied spool-holder mounted on top of the printer. The frame will support several spools with ease.

#### MMU2S:

The MMU2S is supplied with different spool-holders than the MK2/S and MK3/S. It is a continuation of the spool holder design used for the first MMU. It has been tested through thousands of hours of printing and was proven functional.

When the MMU unit is changing the filament, it unloads it from the orange/white PTFE tube situated between the extruder and the MMU unit, meaning that roughly 450 mm of filament is retracted. That is why it is recommended to arrange the spool holders at about 400 mm behind the printer (green line).

Our solution for dealing with retracted filament is a device called the filament buffer. The filament string creates a loop inside in order to prevent tangling. The setup requires a space of at least 70 × 100 cm.

On a tray-design spool-holder, make sure the filament is feeding out from below the spool. Having it pull filament from over the top can cause it to tip over when loading.

#### MINI:

The ideal location for the spool with the Prusa MINI is right next to the LCD-screen. This creates the smallest footprint possible. If you have the space is also possible to have it sideways next to the printer, pointing towards the printer. Most important is that the filament does not bend at an acute angle.

If you do not have the box your MINI originally came in you will need a sturdy cardboard box with dimensions of at least 48,5 × 40,5 × 26,5 cm (19 × 16 × 10 in).

#### Zip-ties

You will need some zip ties (also known as hose-ties/cable-ties/strips) or similar fasteners. The shorter the length, the more you might need.

If the zip ties are too short, remember you can always tie one zip tie to another.

#### Packaging material

Protective padding material is important. The best is to crumpled up paper, like old newspapers or ads. Layer this on top and around each component being packed. **Foam peanuts or shredded paper are not suitable!**

To secure the nozzle, you will need a small piece of cardboard or packaging foam/bubble-wrap of **50 × 100 × 100 mm / 2 × 4 × 4inches.** For example, you can cut a piece of the white foam that was used in the original box.

### How to pack the printer

The printer should be disassembled when returned to us for service or return. Follow the guide [Packing MINI printer for return - Custom Packing Material](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/packing-mini-printer-for-return-custom-packing-material_245572) to pack down the printer properly.

Document your packing procedures in case of damage during transit.

# [Selftest failed (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-failed-mini-mini_112055)

The selftest verifies the most important components of the printer. It is the first part of the wizard, which will start when you turn on the printer for the first time, or you can start it from _LCD Menu - > Calibration -> Selftest_.

Each part of the test can also be run individually from _LCD Menu - > Calibration -> Test FANs / Test XYZ-axis / Test heaters._ You can always check the results of the previously completed selftest from _LCD Menu - Calibration - Show selftest results_.

### What it tests

* Hotend Fan
* Print fan
* X-axis
* Y-axis
* Z-axis
* Hotend (nozzle) heater
* Heatbed heater



Pay close attention to both the printer and the LCD display. A green checkmark (✔) should appear by the part being tested. If all is green you are good to go.

With the exception of the heaters, a red **X** will appear next to the tested component if it fails. **Make a note of where it failed and let the self-test complete.** If anything does not check out, it will produce the message:

**"The self-test failed to finish. Double-check the printer's wiring and axes".**

If a heater (hotend or heatbed) will fail the selftest, the printer will, for safety reasons, reboot and produce an error screen.

**If the magnetic flexible steel sheet is not on the machine it will fail the Selftest**

when checking the hotend and bed heater. For more details of how each component is tested, please see

[the Github release notes](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy/releases/tag/v4.3.0)

.

### Troubleshoot a failed component

#### Fans

**Verify if there is nothing blocking the rotation of the fans** \- Debris might get between the blades. Bigger parts can be cleared with tweezers, and dust can be cleared with a computer cleaner spray.

Hold the fan with your hand while using the compressed air otherwise, you might damage the blades.

#### Axes

* Move the axes by hand to make sure there is nothing hindering their path.
* Make sure that the belt pulleys are secured on the Y- and X-motor shaft. One of the set-screws must be firmly tightened **over the flat part of the motor shaft.**
* Check if the belts aren't extremely loose, as they might skip on the teeth of the belt-pulley.
* Try to clean, then apply lubricant to the smooth rods.
* If a failure happens on the Z-axis, it could indicate [a problem with the M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/m-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing-mini-mini_134021).



#### Heaters

* Make sure the flexible steel sheet is on the bed.
* Make sure the ambient temperature is above 18 °C.
* Make sure the printer is not standing in a draft or close to an air condition unit.



In case of issues with either heater (bed/hotend), a **red error screen will fill the LCD display** , showing [the error and a QR-code](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/qr-error-codes_176114) which will link you to an article for troubleshooting the component. In case this happens, check the wiring on the Buddy board.

Before checking the wiring, make sure you turn off and unplug the power!

Open the electronics box by the screw in the printed cable cover. Check if all of the cables are well connected. In case you find any loose connections, plug it back in and make sure **you feel/hear the safety-latch lock into place.** After that, close the box, turn the printer back on, and restart the Selftest or Wizard in the Calibration Menu.

Make sure you have checked your wiring before contacting support. It is crucial for further investigation.

### Saving the Selftest results

This is a feature for advanced users.

Starting from firmware version **4.3.2** , if you have a USB drive (FAT32) connected to the MINI/+ when performing the Selftest, the printer will save three logfiles into the drive as a text file. In the files, you can see the results for the tests on the two fans, the two heaters, and the three axes.

These files might be used for troubleshooting any selftest issues which have not been resolved through normal troubleshooting.

Your printer's **serial number** is contained in each file. It is recommended to remove the serial number from the file before sharing them publicly.

# [Unpacking a CW1](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/unpacking-a-cw1_112108)

The Original Prusa Curing and Washing Machine (CW1) is a ​3-in-1 device​ designed for quick and easy post-processing of objects printed from liquid resins.

Objects printed from liquid resin are usually a bit soft and sticky. To clean them and give them optimal surface properties, the ​objects need to be washed, dried, and cured.​ This process involves​ washing​ the object in isopropyl alcohol, ​drying​ using hot air, and ​curing using UV light. The Original Prusa Curing and Washing Machine (CW1) can take care of all these actions in 10 minutes. However, some caution needs to be exercised when handling liquid resins and isopropyl alcohol.


Any time you handle resins (even 3D prints with traces of liquid resin) or isopropyl alcohol, wear protective gloves! Resins and IPA have distinctive odors - consider wearing a simple respirator in case you find the odors irritating. The Original Prusa CW1 should be placed in a well-ventilated area!

###  Package contents


* Stainless steel liquid container (gastro pan)
* Magnetic propeller
* Metal basket - for small object washing
* Metal container lid with a print platform attaching mechanism
* External power supply unit



#### Recommended accessories (not included):

After you open the box, remove the accessories case first (1), then remove the top foam (2). Grab the box using the two handles on the side and pull it up (3). Open the cardboard locks (4) and remove the foam protectors along with the protective wrap (5). Finally, take the unpacked CW1 and place it on a stable surface (6)

Open the CW1’s acrylic lid, remove the top foam protector (1), then slide down the lower foam protector (2) and pull the liquid container along with the protector towards you (3). Remove the plastic wrap from the tank and take out the metal basket

* To ensure ​safe and optimal work experience,​ the CW1 should be placed in a location that meets the following conditions:
* Place the machine in a ​horizontally stable position -​ the best place is a workbench. A good practice is to put a plastic tablecloth under the machine in case a resin / IPA spill occurs.
* The ​external power supply​ should be placed in such a manner that will prevent anyone from tripping over the cable or damaging it.
* Do not place the device next to a source of water or into a wet environment



If you find any of the content listed missing from the package, or damaged straight from the box, contact our

# [Using the CW1 - Washing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/using-the-cw1-washing_112124)

Connect the external power supply to the CW1 and plug it into the power source. To disconnect the cable, push the connector’s cover away from the CW1 to unlock the connector, then pull it out. Turn the device on by using the mechanical switch next to the power supply connector.

Once you turn the CW1 on, the display in the front will light up. The knob next to the display is the main control device. Rotate it left or right to select items on the screen and push it to confirm the selection/change options.

### Preparing the liquid container

Before you start the washing process, you need to prepare the isopropyl alcohol bath.

Prepare the stainless steel tank and the magnetic propeller. Place the magnetic propeller into the tank so it lays flat on the bottom. Blades must point upwards. Carefully pour isopropyl alcohol into the tank. The surface should be about 2-3 cm (about 1 in.) below the edge of the tank.

### Washing

Place the liquid container with the propeller and isopropyl alcohol into the CW1 so it rests on the two guiding rails. There is a sensor in the back that can detect the presence of the tank. You can tell whether the tank has been correctly placed when the text on the display changes to Start washing. If the tank is not present, the text will change to Start Drying / Curing.

We recommend washing the printed object while it’s still attached to the printing platform. However, if you don’t have the Original Prusa SL1, or if the initial washing did not remove some resin (e.g. under dense supports), you can use the metal basket to wash the object by itself.

Isopropyl alcohol is a volatile flammable liquid, don’t leave the lid closed when the liquid container is in the CW1!

### Washing an object attached to the SL1 printing platform

After a print finishes, open the acrylic lid of the SL1 and place a protective tray around the resin tank. Use a plastic spatula or paper towels to wipe resin from the top of the printing platform. Release the black knob and remove the printing platform - wear gloves!

Carefully move the printing platform to the CW1. Take the metal lid with the attaching mechanism and push the button at the top with your thumb - this will unlock the mechanism. Slide the printing platform onto the hexagon-shaped adapter and release the button.

Now place the lid on top of the liquid container so the print is submerged in isopropyl alcohol. This is the recommended procedure because both the platform and the object are washed.

Select Start washing on the display and the machine will wash the object for 3 minutes (default value). You can change the washing time by either rotating the knob during the process or by selecting Run-time option before the print. We do not recommend washing objects in isopropyl alcohol for more than 10 minutes - tiny cracks may appear on the surface of printed objects (even after more than 24 hours), which is the result of long exposure to IPA.

### Washing small objects / objects removed from the printing platform

After a print finishes, open the lid of the SL1 and place a protective tray around the resin tank. Use a plastic spatula or paper towels to clean the top of the printing platform. Release the black knob and remove the printing platform - wear gloves!

Use a metal spatula to remove the printed object from the printing platform. You can also consider removing the supports at this point

Place the object in the metal basket and insert it into the liquid container. Place the liquid container into the CW1 so it rests on the guiding rails.

Select Start washing on the display and the machine will wash the object for 3 minutes (default value). You can change the washing time by either rotating the knob during the process or by selecting Run-time option before the print. We do not recommend washing objects in isopropyl alcohol for more than 10 minutes - tiny cracks may appear on the surface of printed objects (even after more than 24 hours), which is the result of long exposure to IPA.

### After washing

Wearing protective gloves, remove the object from the tank and remove the tank itself as well. You can now dry and cure the model.

# [Using the CW1 - Drying and Curing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/using-the-cw1-drying-and-curing_112137)

After you wash the object in isopropyl alcohol, we recommend rinsing it ​briefly under running water​ to remove the remnants of isopropyl alcohol. Then, dry it with a paper towel. Remove the tank from the CW1 and place the object on the rotating platform. Don’t place it in the center, instead, place it near the edge of the platform. Another option is to insert the whole printing platform with the object still attached.

Close the lid.​ The CW1 will recognize that the tank has been removed and offer Drying and Curing modes on the LCD screen. ​Always keep the lid closed​ - there’s a safety switch in the lid that will stop the process in case you open the lid. ​Select ‘Start drying/curing’ on the LCD screen.

The drying and curing times are set to ​3 minutes​ each. It’s a default value that works well for a majority of 3D printed objects. In case you would still find the object a bit sticky, you can re-run the process​ until you reach the optimal result. You can set the run-times either via the Run-time menu or during the process itself by rotating the knob.

Once these actions finish, the CW1 will let you know with a beep (default settings, the sound notification can be disabled).

---

# [CW1 maintenance](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cw1-maintenance_112145)

To ensure that the CW1 remains in proper working order, ​keep the device clean, and never leave the tank with isopropyl alcohol inside of the device when the machine is off / not being used. Clean any resin drops or stains immediately, before they solidify.

### Spilled isopropyl alcohol

The CW1 is designed to ​withstand a moderate IPA spill​ - the liquid will pour through the device. It’s a good practice to keep a plastic tablecloth under the device in case of spillage.

In case a ​spill occurs​ and the liquid pours into the CW1, ​disconnect the machine from the power supply, ​wipe off any remaining IPA from the device’s surface and wait for a couple of hours (e.g. 2-3) until the isopropyl alcohol evaporates completely from the inside. The machine has a hole in the bottom plate through which the IPA will pour out. High-quality isopropyl alcohol will not damage the electronics inside the device.

Do not clean the opaque cover of the CW1/S with IPA or ethanol. It can cause the plexiglass to deteriorate and crack.

### Used IPA - Recycling / disposing

Please note that isopropyl alcohol is consumable​ and it will become saturated with resin over time, which is normal. Only when you notice that the ​washing performance is decreased,​ consider exchanging the IPA in the CW1 tank - this usually happens after several months of use, depending on the frequency of usage.

See your country’s laws regarding safe and appropriate disposal methods of IPA in your location​ - usually, it should be treated as a ​hazardous liquid,​ because it will also contain photoinitiators, polymers, and oligomers from the resin. You can usually find places for disposing of dangerous liquids near gas stations or fire stations.

# [Photo and video documentation](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/photo-and-video-documentation_112155)

Pictures and videos are an important part of troubleshooting. When one of our agents is trying to help you with an issue, they often rely on pictures and videos to get a better understanding of the issue at hand. **Photo and video documentation is also a part of our warranty terms.**

Therefore, we want to go through some advice and guidelines regarding shooting and sharing photo and video content.

There are security concerns regarding the sharing of files online. We will not download videos compressed into a Zip format, nor download files to our hard drive.

### Guidelines when shooting photos and video

#### The specific machine under troubleshooting

Example pictures and screenshots from, for instance, our assembly manual, is of no assistance. We are helping you with your machine, so we need to see **your specific machine.** It is not helpful to see other printers, as there are always nuances to your specific case. Example: "Pictures in the third post of this forum thread is exactly like my issue" is unfortunately not sufficient.

#### Well lit and in focus

Make sure the object is well-lit and in focus before sending pictures or videos. On a small handheld screen it is not always obvious when important detail is missing, so zoom in to make sure, Also, use your camera's flash unless it burns out the picture.

#### Super Close-up

We often require general shots of “extruder” or ”frame” and with the resolution now available in modern handhelds there is rarely a need to go in very close, especially if it is well lit. Mostly it will end with you having to take and send more pictures.

#### Camera orientation

It is a common oversight to shoot video holding the phone in portrait orientation. The image chip in your phone’s camera always has its resolution in the same orientation as its screen, so when shooting video in this manner **we lose about two-thirds of the resolution** (illustration below) when it is displayed on a normal 'landscape' monitor. This removes detail important for the support agent. **Please shoot video in Landscape orientation.**

### How to share

#### Cloud of your choice

Both through email and Live Chat there is a 10 Mb data cap. Therefore, we often rely on your cloud services like Dropbox, Imgur, and Youtube to receive the material.

#### Google Drive and Youtube

Many of us use Gmail. With that, you have both access to Google Drive and Youtube. There are many guides out there on using Youtube. We found this clear and to-the-point guide from Wix.

Regarding Google Drive, right-click the file, after uploading, and select "Get shareable link". In the dialog box that will open, make sure the option "Anyone with the link" is selected.

#### Imgur

Imgur is a site where you can upload photos without having an account. Per email and chat pictures are not really a problem, due to their small size, but it can be handy if you have a whole series of pictures. It also has good support for uploading directly from handhelds. wikiHow made a good guide on how to use this.

# [Mesh bed leveling](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mesh-bed-leveling_112163)

The Original Prusa FDM printers have a sensor to detect distance from the print surface. During a calibration, and before each print, the sensor will go through a number of points, in a grid pattern, spread across the build-plate (whether it is a powder-coated or smooth PEI sheet does not matter), and measures the distance to the sheet. These points are interpolated and used to create a virtual mesh of the bed. During printing, if the bed is slightly warped, the sensor will still precisely follow the surface according to its measured mesh

### Original Prusa MK2/2.5/S, MK3/S/+

These printers are equipped with a PINDA sensor, apart from the MK3S+, which is equipped with a SuperPINDA sensor.

The StallGuard for the Z-axis is active during the mesh bed leveling. In case the nozzle crashes into the bed before the PINDA sensor triggers, the calibration process is interrupted and the user is asked to check the nozzle for any kind of debris.

#### Mesh bed leveling settings

This feature is available starting from firmware 3.7.0.

The Mesh bed leveling settings can be found within _Settings - Mesh bed Leveling_ , on the LCD menu. There you have the following options:

* Mesh (3x3 - 7x7)
* Z-probe nr. (1 - 3 - 5)
* Magnet comp. (ON / OFF)



**Mesh:** The default grid density is 3x3 (9 points). However, if you still experience uneven first layer adhesion, you can increase the density in Settings - Mesh bed leveling - Mesh to 7x7 (49 points).

**Z-probe nr.:** Changing the Z-sensor nr. you change how many times will each point be measured. We suggest either 3 or 5 measurements per point since the final value is calculated as an average value. Changing these settings affects how long will the Mesh bed leveling procedure takes to complete.

**Magnet comp.:** With 7x7 Mesh bed leveling, you can choose whether or not to use Magnets compensation. 3 of the 49 points are so close to magnets, that the reading can be off by as much as 80μm (microns). Magnet compensation ignores readings from these 3 points and calculates them from the surrounding points. **We suggest leaving this function on.**

#### Enforcing the Z-calibration

If the mesh bed leveling is interrupted during the procedure, before a print, a message will appear on the screen stating "Enforcing the Z-calibration" and the printer will re-home and run through the procedure again. This can occur if there is debris on the nozzle pushing the bed down when probing, or if you touch and press the bed while it is probing. This will bring the deviance above a certain threshold and it will simply make another attempt to run the Mesh Bed Leveling. This is to avoid starting it from the menu again if the problem was simply an accident. If the problem remains, it will repeat this procedure three times before canceling the print.

#### Troubleshooting

Please see our dedicated article [P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA Sensor testing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/p-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing_2091) to resolve any issue.

### Original Prusa MINI/+

The Original Prusa MINI is equipped with a M.I.N.D.A. sensor, while the Original Prusa MINI+ is equipped with a SuperPINDA sensor. The grid density is 4x4.

#### Troubleshooting

Please see our dedicated article [M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor testing (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/m-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing-mini-mini_134021) to resolve any issue.

### Original Prusa XL and Original Prusa MK4

The Original Prusa XL and the Original Prusa MK4 are equipped with a [**loadcell**](https://help.prusa3d.com/preview/article/loadcell-xl), to detect that the nozzle is close enough to the steel sheet for printing, and to avoid damage that would be caused by the nozzle digging into the steel sheet.

Before a print, the nozzle will check the distance to the print sheet in several places to create a virtual height map of the surface. The points are measured within the area of the chosen print.

The sensor must be over the bed. The maximum travel distance before an error is triggered is 10mm.

Show/print PINDA temperature interpolating.

This G-code is used to calibrate the temperature drift of the PINDA (inductive Sensor).

The PINDAv2 sensor has a built-in thermistor which has the advantage that the calibration can be done once for all materials.

The Original i3 Prusa MK2/s uses PINDAv1 and this calibration improves the temperature drift, but not as good as the PINDAv2.

SuperPINDA sensor has internal temperature compensation and no thermistor output. There is no point of doing temperature calibration in such case. If PINDA_THERMISTOR and SUPERPINDA_SUPPORT is defined during compilation, calibration is skipped with serial message "No PINDA thermistor". This can be caused also if PINDA thermistor connection is broken or PINDA temperature is lower than PINDA_MINTEMP.

#### Example

G76

echo PINDA probe calibration start

echo start temperature: 35.0°

echo ...

echo PINDA temperature -- Z shift (mm): 0.***

Default 3x3 grid can be changed on MK2.5/s and MK3/s to 7x7 grid.

#### Usage


G80 [ N | R | V | L | R | F | B ]


#### Parameters

*     N

\- Number of mesh points on x axis. Default is 3. Valid values are 3 and 7.
*     R

\- Probe retries. Default 3 max. 10
*     V

\- Verbosity level 1=low, 10=mid, 20=high. It only can be used if the firmware has been compiled with SUPPORT_VERBOSITY active.



Using the following parameters enables additional "manual" bed leveling correction. Valid values are -100 microns to 100 microns.

#### Additional Parameters

*     L

\- Left Bed Level correct value in um.
*     R

\- Right Bed Level correct value in um.
*     F

\- Front Bed Level correct value in um.
*     B

\- Back Bed Level correct value in um.

#### Usage


M406

Save current parameters to EEPROM.

Set the active parameters to those stored in the EEPROM. This is useful to revert parameters after experimenting with them.

This command resets all tunable parameters to their default values, as set in the firmware's configuration files. This doesn't reset any parameters stored in the EEPROM, so it must be followed by M500 to write the default settings.

This command asks the firmware to reply with the current print settings as set in memory. Settings will differ from EEPROM contents if changed since the last load / save. The reply output includes the G-Code commands to produce each setting. For example, Steps-Per-Unit values are displayed as an M92 command.

Resets the language to English. Only on Original Prusa i3 MK2.5/s and MK3/s with multiple languages.

#### Usage


M540 [ S ]


#### Parameters

*     S

Sets the Z-probe Z offset. This offset is used to determine the actual Z position of the nozzle when using a probe to home Z with G28. This value may also be used by G81 (Prusa) / G29 (Marlin) to apply correction to the Z position. This value represents the distance from nozzle to the bed surface at the point where the probe is triggered. This value will be negative for typical switch probes, inductive probes, and setups where the nozzle makes a circuit with a raised metal contact. This setting will be greater than zero on machines where the nozzle itself is used as the probe, pressing down on the bed to press a switch. (This is a common setup on delta machines.)

#### Usage

# [Resin Calibration (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/resin-calibration-sl1-sl1s_112182)

Both Original Prusa SL1 and SL1S SPEED have a growing library of resin print profiles in the PrusaSlicer, which were tested and verified by Prusa Research. However, the printers are also open to any other 3rd-party resins. **The material has to be compatible with MSLA technology and cured with 405nm UV light.** To achieve the best results with any compatible resin you need to find its exact exposure time.

For this reason, both **SL1 and SL1S include a resin calibration feature.** This helps you evaluate your resin using a set of printed objects, where each object from the set is cured with a different exposure time. Throughout this article, you will learn the procedure, and how to select the best object and exposure time.

**This procedure is as follows:**

* Prepare the printer.
* Download the calibration projects.
* Print the calibration projects.
* Evaluate the printed objects.
* Create a PrusaSlicer resin profile (preset).



This feature is implemented from version 1.3.0 on the SL1 and 1.7.0 on SL1S SPEED.

Use a FEP film that is almost brand new, with no significant scratches or dirt. This is to ensure there are no defects that might affect the light passing through.

### What you need

* A fully functional and calibrated SL1 or SL1S SPEED printer.
* **Latest firmware installed:** Navigate the menu to System -> Firmware -> and select Check for updates. Alternatively, the firmware file can be downloaded from our Downloads page and flashed using a memory stick. Please see [Firmware updating (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-sl1-sl1s_124776) for details.



### Calibration Process

1. From the Home screen, enter _Settings - > Support ->_ _Download Examples._


3. Allow your SL1/SL1S to download and extract the example files. _This can take a minute depending on your internet connection._


4. Navigate back to the Home-screen and select _Print - > Local -> Examples -> Calibration Objects._ Here you will find a list of files for calibrating for different layer heights [ _0.025 mm - 0.05 mm - 0.1 mm_ ]. Select the layer height you want to calibrate for. _If unsure, we recommend using the 0.05 mm layer height object._



**Not all resins are suitable for all layer heights. Pigment content and viscosity can impact how deep the UV light will penetrate.** Read your resin's documentation or check with the manufacturer to be sure.

5. When you swipe to the right, the screen will have two choices - _Print Settings_ and _Print_. If you press _Print Settings_ you will see that you have 4 options: _Exposure [second], Exposure time incr. [second]_ and _First Layer Expo. [second]._ Here you can set the exposure time in and incremented time per object printed. Additionally, you can also [change the speed profile for the print (Faster/Slower/High Viscosity)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/print-profile-sl1-sl1s_235270).



**For exotic resins or types/brands that you do not know anything about,** it is a good idea to explore the exposure times from a wide to a narrow range. Some industrial resins can require a very long exposure time (around 10s for SL1S or 30s for SL1). A good practice is **starting with an increment of 1s for SL1S SPEED or 3s for SL1** , to cover a wide range of exposure times. From the best-looking calibration objects, you can determine the more narrow range, before repeating the process with a shorter exposure increment to get more accurate results.

To have an idea about approximate exposure time we recommend checking what the manufacturer of the resin state for similar types of printers. Take into account that the **SL1 is RGB MSLA** and **SL1S SPEED is Mono MSLA** technology **.** If you have any such comparable exposure times, you can narrow in the range of exposure times and incremented time.

The SL1S SPEED, with its monochrome display, will cure most resins 2-3 times faster than the Original Prusa SL1.

6. At the fourth layer, the actual exposure times per object will be included as part of the model. Being physically printed with the object it makes the evaluation after the print is finished easier.


7. As soon as the print is finished, wash and cure your print as normal, then take a closer look at the printed objects. You should look for:


*     *       * **Missing elements/geometry**
* **Deformations**
* **Holes**
* **Merged parts of geometry**
* **Any other flaws**
*   * Take a look at the picture below used as an example. Notice that the frame of the glasses and the lenses are damaged or completely missing with an interval between 6 to 9 seconds. The first useable exposure time is 10 and 11 seconds.



Letters/digits are a good indicator of overexposure - they will be too thick and melt together.

_An example of how geometry forms can be found in the calibration object's glasses, where the actual glass within the frame will not be printed if exposure duration is set too low._

You can also use the 3D view of the [3D model itself at Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/17577-sl1-resin-calibration-object) (formerly PrusaPrinters.org), or download it to your computer and open it there for inspection. Here you will see all the tiny details that this model has. However, not all resins are made to print fine details. Undefined details are not always a sign of underexposure.

_3D view of the calibration object at Printables.com_

### Creating a PrusaSlicer preset

**Did you find the best exposure time for your resin? Great!** You can start a normal print right away, adjusting the exposure time on the printer's display before the print or you can create your own resin profile:

1. **Open PrusaSlicer** and in the Plater view, select from the list of the printers (green arrow), Original Prusa SL1/SL1S SPEED, depending on which you have.
2. From SLA print settings (purple arrow), select the layer height you want to calibrate the resin for. This will load all the available resins.


1. Click on the **"Material settings"** tab on top.
2. Select any resin from the dropdown list with the layer height you intend to calibrate for. It will be used as a base for your new profile. Then click on the **"Save** " icon (?) next to the list (blue arrow).
3. A dialogue will open up where you **name the preset** (e.g. "My new calibrated resin") and hit "OK".
4. In the new resin, the profile **adjusts the fields "Initial Exposure time" and "Exposure time"** (red square), which sets the time for which each layer of the sliced object is exposed to the UV light.
5. Now, you are good to go. Slice your next model and Happy Printing!



### Video

The video below covers the procedure on the Original Prusa SL1, but the procedure for the SL1S SPEED is almost the same.

# [IR Filament Sensor (MK2.5S, MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-mk2-5s-mk3s_112214)

Due to some inconsistencies in readings from the [optical filament sensor](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-sensor-mk3-non-s_2125) we created the S-upgrade to address this. The new IR filament sensor still uses an optical sensor but is triggered by a mechanical action designed into the new plastic parts of the MK3S, MMU2S, and MK2.5S extruder.

The new filament sensor does not detect clogging but is much more robust and reliable for Autoload and run-out detection.

### Autoload

Autoload is a function that, if the hotend is heated, will start the loading procedure once filament is detected. This can be turned ON and OFF from _Settings - > Autoload_, on the LCD-panel. The filament sensor must be turned on, from the same menu, to be able to utilize the Autoload feature.

If you are doing a cold pull or troubleshooting the extruder and hotend it may be wise to disable Autoload.

### Running out of filament

If you run out of filament, the printer will automatically pause the print, move the X-carriage away from the print and prompt you to unload the remaining few centimeters of the material from the heatbreak and replace the spool and insert a new filament.

#### The printer will guide you on how to resume printing safely:

1. _"Please press the knob to unload the filament"_ = Press the knob to unload the remaining few centimeters of the filament.
2. _"Repeat unloading filament?_ **[Yes/No]** = If everything went well, press **[Yes]**. If not, then press **[No]**. The printer will lock the x-axis motor and will allow you to open the extruder idler to clear the remains of the filament manually.
1. To open the extruder idler, simply release the spring screw running through the extruder, holding the idler-door.
2. Then, you can use the bundled pliers to remove the filament remains. If some of it got stuck in the top PTFE tube, simply push it out with new filament.
3. Close the extruder idler by re-tightening spring tensioned screw. The Head of the screw should be about flush with the plastic parts when the filament is loaded.
3. _"Insert filament and press the knob"_ = Make sure to insert the same type of filament, cut the tip of the filament and insert the filament and press the knob.
4. _"Changed correctly?"_ **[Yes/Filament not loaded/Color not clear]** = If everything went fine and the new filament is coming out nicely (and has the right color), simply select **[Yes]**. If you think that the filament was not loaded properly, select **[Filament not loaded]** , which will push through the same amount of filament as before. If the color is not clear, then select **[Color not clear]** , this way it will push through only a bit of filament.



If you are uncertain of the readings from the sensor you can check its readings from Support -> Sensor Info, on the LCD-panel.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems with loading or detection by the filament sensor, [please see our troubleshooting article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-troubleshooting-mk2-5s-mk3s_112226).

---

# [IR Filament Sensor Troubleshooting (MK2.5S, MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-troubleshooting-mk2-5s-mk3s_112226)

The IR sensor is a **hybrid solution** that combines an **IR laser** sensor triggered by a tiny **mechanical lever**. This means that in case one of the functions of the IR sensor is not working, the source of the issue might not be the sensor itself.

* Autoload not working.
* Filament sensor runout not working.
* The printer asking you at the beginning of a print to unload the filament and then to load it back in.



If you have to do some emergency prints before resolving the issue, you can always disable the filament sensor from

_LCD menu - > Settings -> Fil. Sensor [OFF]_

.

### Wrong firmware

There are two different versions of the firmware available, one for the S and S+ upgrade and one for the initial filament-sensor. Make sure you have the correct one. **The new IR Filament sensor requires the S/S+ version of the firmware.**

Having the incorrect firmware will often, but not always, cause it to fail calibration due to the different designs of the extruder parts.

### Wiring

The connector should be on the **bottom row of pins, covering all pins, with the red wire on the right.** See the picture below. The only correct orientation is depicted on the top-left.

**The cables for MK3/S/+ and MK2.5/S IR filament sensors are different**

as they have different mainboards.

[On MK2.5/S the white wire is shifted one pin to the right](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-electronics_52680#53456)

. The picture below depicts the MK3/S/+ cable, but the position and orientation of the connector remain the same on the two models.

### Assembly of the extruder

**Before going into disassembly you should check some key parts** of your extruder assembly. You may have overtightened some screws which can affect the tight tolerances used in the trigger mechanism.

There have been some reported issues when overtightening the screws pictured below. Navigate to _LCD Menu - > Support -> Sensor info_ and see if the 'Fil. Sensor' value (1 or 0) when adjusted.

* The M3x40 screw going from the back into the extruder motor (orange arrow left picture).
* The M2x8 screw securing the IR sensor itself (purple arrow right picture).
* The printed part 'adapter-printer' for the steel ball is protruding slightly above the surface of the surrounding extruder parts (yellow arrows right picture).
* The M3x10 screw securing the 'FS-cover' plate, which covers the filament sensor chip and 'adapter-printer' depicted to the right.



#### Access the filament sensor mechanism

The FS lever is the part that is moved by the filament to activate the sensor. It is important that this moves as expected.

1.     1. The first step is to toggle the Filament autoload off. Do it in the LCD Menu -> Settings -> F. autoload. (but 'Fil. sensor' must be still ON!)
2. Now we need to get to the filament sensor mechanism. Before you start, make sure the printer is cold and that none of the fans are spinning.
1. [Take the Print fan off](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/yIXWVKJiIHK1wA1j.jpg) by unscrewing both M3x20 screws holding it on the Extruder. Do not lose the nuts for these screws. You can insert the fan in between the belts on the left side, it should fit there just fine.
2. Unscrew 2 out of 4 screws of the Noctua Hotend fan that are the closest to the original position of the Print fan. One of them is [M3x18](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/WERLjOFQpSp3uxeD.jpg) (or M3x20 if you decided to use it instead) and the other one is the [top-right M3x14](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/dcomNGfmdAwFPpp5.jpg).
3. Unscrew [both long M3x40 screws](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/Wgyiha3xORN4hHkZ.jpg) located below the Extruder motor and take the Extruder cover off.
4. Unscrew the [M3x40 screw](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/fN2CbLV5LEm6qGSB.jpg) holding the Extruder idler door as well as the other [M3x40 screw](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/qTuogoV1CDIFwTlJ.jpg) holding the upper part of the assembly together.
5. Take the Extruder motor off.
6. You now have full access to the hotend and to the filament sensor mechanism.



Now you need to go to the _LCD Menu - > Support -> Sensor info_

1.     1. Here you can see the status of **all sensors** we are using on our printers: the 'PINDA', the 'FINDA' (if MMU2S is installed), and the 'IR sensor' (renamed to 'Fil. Sensor' in firmware 3.10.0). _We will only need IR sensor/Fil. Sensor._
2. See how the IR sensor status changes from 0 to 1 as you are inserting a piece of filament inside the opened extruder. Also, observe how the filament sensor lever moves.
3. To be sure, blow some canned air (or just blow with your mouth) in the general direction of the sensor to get rid of any potential dust particles.



The IR sensor value should be a stable 0 when there is no filament and a stable 1 as long as the filament is present.

#### Summary

All in all, **the lever has to move freely** and get pushed by the steel ball in a regular manner.

* Make sure [the steel ball is in its housing](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/XQDovpCCBhPtV4WW-800x600.jpg).
* Make sure that you did not forget to put in the M3x18 screw that serves as a **shaft for the lever movement**. This M3x18 screw also has to be **tightened just right**. Overtightening it makes the lever not move or move insufficiently. Having it too loose might make the lever move in other directions than intended.
* Also, make sure the magnets have the [correct orientation](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/prusuki/prusuki-images/diLOgS6Fx3bFmiVA.jpg). They need to be **repelling one another**.
* The FS-lever has to be printed in black PETG. The color of the extruder plastic parts can be different, but the tiny FS-lever must be black.



After fixing this issue, assemble the extruder following [5\. E-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_28536) you can also turn the **Filament autoload** back on. Re-do the Z calibration, it should not be necessary to re-do the entire XYZ Calibration, unless you have by mistake touched/moved with the P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor.

### Clean up of printed part

If all of the steps above do not solve your issue, and **the IR sensor will continuously trigger,** it may be necessary to do some clean-up of a printed part. The tolerances within the IR filament sensor mechanism are very tight. On some prints of revision R4/C4 of the _extruder-motor-plate,_ it may be necessary to shave off a little bit of material to have the right clearance.

Using an Exacto knife, cut away the plastic ~ **0.5 mm deep around the edge,** marked in the picture below (purple arrow and green measure). In essence, **remove the steps from the layers in the round area where the Fs-lever triggers the sensor.**

When the sensor is removed, you will see if the _extruder-motor-plate_ is still interfering with the _Fs-lever_ , moving it when placed back on.

An alternative is to remove a little bit of material on the FS-lever, but as it is already very small you can easily take off too much.

# [How to remove a stripped screw](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-remove-a-stripped-screw_112234)

If you are trying to unscrew any of the screws in the printer, and the key keeps turning without releasing the screw, it means that the screw is stripped.

You might wish to drill the screw and using an extractor if you have experience using these tools. If you do not have experience, do not attempt it, and follow the tips below.

Do not follow internet tutorials if they are not specific for electronics or sensitive parts. Methods specific for woodworking might damage your printer.

If you have a strong magnet, you can attach it to your Allen key to remove any possible debris and help with the screw extraction.

1. Different Allen key: you might be using an incorrect Allen key, or the tool might be damaged. Try using the other side of the Allen key. This can happen especially for the smaller screws.
2. Better grip of the screw: if the head of the screw is damaged, you can place something between the head of the screw and the Allen key to make the grip better. The most commonly used material are wide rubber bands, but others things can be used: latex gloves, aluminum foil, steel wool. Make constant pressure towards the screw, and **slowly** turn the key until the screw is out.
3. Pliers: if you can see the head of the screw, try to firmly hold the head of the screw with pliers, and rotate the pliers until the screw is loose.



After removing the damaged screw please throw it away to make sure you will not use it again.

# [SL1 Tilt-mechanism error](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sl1-tilt-mechanism-error_112268)

**This error was changed in firmware version 1.5.0! This article only applies to SL1 printers with firmware older than 1.5.0.**

During the Wizard, the SL1 will test the tilting-motion of the print display and resin vat (tank). In case the message **"Please check if the tilting mechanism can move smoothly in its entire range"** appears, the connecting rod cannot move as it should. This could be caused by something obstructing the movement of the tilt-platform or the mechanism not being installed correctly. Follow the steps below to troubleshoot the issue.

Before anything else, check that the tilt-platform does not have anything blocking its movements, like debris or forgotten tools, stuck between the sides of the screen and the tilt mechanism.

### Disassembly and correction.

1. Open the eight M3x5b screws securing the cover. **Be careful to unplug the USB & Power-cable before removing the cover completely.**


2. Remove the M4x10 screw holding the right side of the touch screen. It is not necessary to remove the left screw. Just loosen it about a half-turn and you can slide the screen out, like a door. This will give you access to the motor and connecting rod.



Be very careful with the touch screen flat cable. It is fragile and can be easily damaged or cut.

3. Remove the M3nN-nut from the screw that connects the tilt-mechanism and the connecting rod. You can do that by using a spanner or pliers to hold the nut and an Allen key to unscrew from the other side.


4. Remove the two M4x8 screws securing the tilt-motor holder to the bottom plate.


5. Remove the motor-holder and the connecting-rod from the tilt mechanism.
6. Go to [Step 18](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544#9384) of [2\. Base & Tower](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544) of the assembly guide, and remake the connection of the connecting rod and the motor shaft.



Pay extra attention to this step, as not aligning the connecting rod with the protrusion on the holder as instructed will cause the issue again.

7. Reassemble first the tilt to the connecting rod, make sure that after tightening the nut the two parts are in contact.



Do not over-tighten the nut!

8. Connect the motor holder to the bottom plate using the M4x8 screws.


9. Make sure that the optical sensor cable has its correct end connected to the sensor. The middle wire should be blue. In case the middle wire on the sensor connector is black, the connection will need to be swapped.
10. Move the connecting-rod manually and see if it moves smoothly until the blade sensor-trigger is between the two sides of the sensor.



Make sure the sensor is secured!

11. Slide the LCD back to its place, and tighten both M4x10 screws holding it.


12. Connect the USB and Power cable and close the eight M3x5b screws that hold the cover. Tighten them in diagonally at first, and add all the screws before tightening them. Pay attention to the cables from the electronics so that they are not pinched.


13. Run the wizard again.



**After the wizard finishes, you are ready to calibrate the SL1.**

# [SD cards and USB drives](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sd-cards-and-usb-drives_112291)

As there are ways of remotely transferring files and starting prints, an SD card or USB flash drive is the most common and reliable way to get your files to your machine. Though common and convenient, flash memory is not the most reliable in itself and your storage can be corrupted or fill up without any obvious signs. Therefore, we have put together a small guide on how to maintain, format, and purchase memory for your Original Prusa printer.

### Make sure your SD card is not locked!

The SD card has a latch on the side. Before using your SD card, make sure that the latch is not set to the Locked position. In case it is locked, you will not be able to save files on the card, and the printer will not be able to open the SD card.

### Storage over 32 GB

There is no upper size limit on compatible storage media, but **the built-in Windows formatting tool does not support formatting storage media from a size of 32 GB or more to FAT32.** It will only provide the option for exFAT, which is currently not supported by our printers. There are similar limitations under various versions of Apple's OSx, where a third-party application must be used to format it correctly.

To format such a drive you need a third-party application, like Rufus, FAT32 format, or EaseUS Partition Master. **Be careful when using such programs** so you do not **accidentally format the wrong storage media** , like your hard drive. However, 8-16 GB is more than enough for most use cases, as a G-code file rarely exceeds 100 MB.

### How do I format the USB drive/SD card?

If your SD card or USB drive is full or if you can't read the content of the drive, but the drive is recognized by windows, most often all you need to do is to format the drive.

If your USB drive or SD card does not even show up in your computer file explorer it is probably corrupted beyond repair, or at least beyond the scale of this article. If you get an error like the one in the picture below and it does not show up anywhere, off to google you go, but you might have to consider this card/USB drive lost and get a new one.

### How to format on Windows

On Windows, this is very simple. Locate your USB drive or SD card in my computer, right-click, and choose format.

A new small window will pop up. Most of the time you can simply leave everything to default, but the most important thing is that the **File System is set to FAT32.** This and the Volume Label (Name of the drive) is the only thing you want to touch here. Click Start and your drive will be formatted in a matter of seconds.

Formatting any drive will delete all the content of the drive! Back up your stuff!

If the USB stick will not work even after this procedure, it is either broken or its "partitioning scheme" is set as GPT, which is incorrect.

**It must be set as MBR (Master Boot Record).**

For how to change this, please see

[Microsoft's official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/disk-management/change-a-gpt-disk-into-an-mbr-disk)

.

### How to format on Mac

On Mac, it is a few more steps, but still very accessible. Again, you want to choose **FAT32 as your file system** , but you also have the option of changing the "partitioning scheme", which **should always be MBR (Master Boot Record).**

This process deletes all content from the drive.

1. Plug the USB drive or SD card into your Mac.
2. Go to _Applications - > Utilities_ and launch _Disk Utility._
3. Click on the icon in the top-left (green arrow) and select "Show All Devices" from the drop-down menu.


4. Right-click on the USB drive/SD card in the sidebar under "External". _Select the top entry for your drive, not a partition located below._
5. Select Erase in the Disk Utility-toolbar (purple arrow).


6. Enter a name for the formatted disk.
7. Click on the Format menu and choose MS-DOS (FAT).
8. Make sure the Scheme is set to "Master Boot Record".


9. Click Erase.
10. Your USB drive will now be erased and re-formatted correctly.



If your SD card is not detected by the printer at all, be sure to check out

# [CW1/S - Basic use and LCD-menu](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cw1-s-basic-use-and-lcd-menu_112305)

The Cure/Wash Station (CW1 or CW1S) is used to wash, dry, and cure your resin prints, all in one compact package. While your IPA tank is present, the CW1/S will automatically detect it and allow washing. The tank can stir the IPA thanks to the magnetic propeller. A system of fans, UV LEDs, and a rotational platform will dry and cure your prints, all in one process.

### Operating the CW1/S

To use the CW1/S menu, simply turn the knob left and right to scroll through the options, and press the knob to select the desired function.

1. Lid
2. Control knob
3. LCD screen



The CW1/S will not work if the lid is open.

To start washing simply place your gastro-pan (tank) with IPA and the 3D-printed magnetic impeller on the guiding rails, mount your build-plate to the lid, and start the washing process from the top of the LCD menu.

The option to start drying/curing will only appear once you remove the tank from the guiding rails. When the basket is off of the rails, the option Start drying/curing will be shown on the top of the main screen.

The preheat option allows you to heat up the resin up to 40º C before Drying/Curing the model. Heating up the model before Drying/Curing will make the support easier to remove.

You can change the amount of washing, drying, and curing time from the LCD menu (See menu hierarchy below) depending on your preferences.

If you feel like an **object was not dried or cured enough** , you can run these processes individually. Please go to _Settings- > Advanced settings-> Run mode_, and you will see the options for just **Drying** , just **Curing** , or **Drying + Curing**. When you return to the main menu, the option you selected will be shown as Start Drying / Start Curing on top.

You can change the

**washing time**

by either ​rotating the knob​ during the process or by selecting ​a Run-time option​ before the print.

\- Drying/curing _(without tank)_

\- Washing _(only with tank inserted)_

* Curing run-time
* Drying run-time
* Washing run-time
* Filtering run-time
* Resin preheat time


* Rotation settings
* Curing speed
* Washing speed
* Wash cycles
* Filtering speed
* Run mode

* LCD Brightness
* Information
* Serial number
* Firmware version
* Build number
* Build hash
* Advanced settings (press and hold the knob)
* UVLED intensity
* Factory reset
* Cooldown
* Selftest



While any process is running, click the knob and you will be able to access:

* Pause / Continue
* Stop
* Back



### F.A.Q. - Frequently Asked Questions

* **Q: Is it necessary to dry a freshly washed object before putting it in the CW1/S?**
* A: No, a few drops of IPA are perfectly fine and they will evaporate quickly. However, leftover IPA combined with liquid resin may create white stains on dried/cured objects. See Chapter 9.2 Cured prints have white residue on the surface.


* **Q: How often do I need to replace the IPA in the container?**
* A: This depends on the frequency of washing, but from our experience, the IPA loses its washing properties after around 2 months of frequent use


* **Q: Can I wash an object multiple times?**
* A: Yes, but the total time should not exceed 10 minutes. Tiny cracks may appear on objects that were washed for too long (even after 24 hours).


* **Q: Why does the CW1/S use an IPA bath with a propeller instead of ultrasonic washing?**
* A: Our method has the same efficiency as ultrasonic washing and it’s less aggressive when washing small objects or objects with tiny details


* **Q: Can I cure an object multiple times?**
* A: Yes, extended exposure to UV light is not a problem

# [Food safe FDM printing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/food-safe-fdm-printing_112313)

Food-safe 3D printing is not as simple as it might seem. Here we outline some of the challenges. We also recommend you to check out [our blog article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/how-to-make-food-grade-3d-printed-models_40666/) where we present our research of the process.

### Materials

PETG, and sometimes PLA, are hailed in the 3D printing community for being chemically neutral and as practically food-safe materials. Your soda plastic bottles, food containers, and salad boxes are made from PET, a close relative of PETG.

The problem, with all 3d-printed objects, in general, is that they are made from layers. The grooves in between those layers are a seedbed for bacteria as they are almost impossible to clean properly, and will hold residue.

Another issue is color-pigment and unknown additives. These might not be as neutral to your body as pure plastic. It is also hard to say exactly how much there is of these substances. Natural/pure PETG-filament without any color, would be your best bet, but it's hard to say exactly what is in it. Some filaments are FDA-approved, but often with an asterisk like "Approved except red, orange, and pink". In [our blog article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/how-to-make-food-grade-3d-printed-models_40666/) we map out which of our Prusament filaments you can and can not use.

There are, however, food-safe certified epoxy coatings that you can apply to your printed model.

### Application

**Waterbottle, no. Cookiecutter, maybe.** There should not be much problem to 3d-print your own custom cookie-cutters, but as the layer-lines will collect food, bacteria will grow, so this will be something you want to throw away after some use.

The same goes for soap and detergent if you think you can just wash it. The layer lines can absorb these chemicals, which later can be released into something you want to consume.

### (M)SLA resin printers have practically no lines. Can't I use this?

Again, no. There can be uncured resin and other contaminants on and in the print. There are bio-compatible resins out there, but these are highly specialized and very expensive. They also rely on special considerations when curing and in post-processing.

### Nozzle

The nozzle you use also makes a difference. The standard brass nozzle is **not considered food-safe** , as it wears out. It is a consumable. Where does the worn material go? Into your print. Therefore, a soft brass nozzle just won't do. You would need a stainless-steel or a titanium nozzle if you are even considering printing with food in mind.

### So what can I do?

There are epoxy resin coating-materials out there that have been deemed suitable. There is also the option of using 3d-prints simply as a mold with suitable materials and manufacturing methods. We have done some research and you can read more about food-safe 3D printing in [this blog article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/how-to-make-food-grade-3d-printed-models_40666/).

### Conclusion

It is theoretically possible, but special preparations and post-processing is required. If you really want to, it is not as simple as getting some PETG, and printing what you want. Do proper research, so you do not put anyone's health or safety at risk!

**We do not recommend using 3d-prints as food-containers etc!**

# [Watertight prints](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/watertight-prints_112324)

A print coming from molten plastic one might assume that it is water-tight, but that is not always the case. How to make an object look good and what makes it watertight does not always overlap. That said, the tips presented here might help you make your printed parts more robust, even if they should not be a container for liquid.

**Watertight does not mean[food safe!](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/food-safe-fdm-printing_112313)**

Foodsafe 3d prints is (potentially) another can of worms!

### Geometry

The shape of the model obviously matters. Thick walls which require infill is often waste in this case. It can cause irregularities and may leak into the void between the inner and outer walls, creating a place where all kinds of nasty stuff can grow.

**A wall should be even.** Artifacts like protrusions for showing the water-level etc. can cause issues. In the picture below is a PLA print where everything is water-tight, except by a little nubbin for this purpose.

### Perimeters

More of them! You want to go with **at least 3-4 perimeters for a single wall.** Depending on the geometry you can also increase this to 5-6, but is rarely necessary.

### Temperature

More of if it! To ensure a proper bond between the layers we would recommend raising **the Nozzle-temperature with 5-10C** over the presets available or use the highest recommended temperature on the box of the filament (You can also go about 5c above this). Some experimentation needed.

### Extrusion-multiplier

This refers to the Flow-rate of the filament and is set in PrusaSlicer under Filament Settings. **Increase this by 5-10 percent from the default value.** Another way of manipulating this is to set the line-width 5-10% wider (i.e. from 0.4mm to 0.44mm), but this can affect other aspects of your print. If in doubt experiment, or do the simple option.

### Layer-height

Very high layer-heights just won't do, but having very tight layers will also increase the number of places where something can go wrong. [CNC-kitchen](https://youtu.be/fbSQvJJjw2Q) found that the most durable prints were a **t 0.15mm height, but 0.2 will do fine.** If you want to print fast and have very high layers (like 0.4mm+) get a larger nozzle. Generally, for best results, you should not use a height of more than 60-65% of your nozzle-width.

### XY-Overlap and other settings

This applies more to if your print is leaking from the bottom, and you have tested with the previous suggestions. XY-Overlap is a variable in PrusaSlicer that says how much a line of solid infill crosses the perimeter. This is by default set to 25% (of nozzle diameter, so 0.1mm). Increasing the temperature and extrusion-multiplier will in turn affect this, but if you are still seeing leakage you can try to increase this to 40-50%.

### Materials

These tricks should work with most materials. On materials like ASA or ABS, these tricks might not be necessary if you simply vapor-smooth your prints with acetone.

# [XYZ Calibration (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_112351)

The XYZ calibration is a process, which checks, whether the printer was assembled correctly and the axes are perpendicular to each other. It measures the skew of your X/Y axis and applies compensations for any imperfections. It may indicate two sets of error messages **compromised/failed.** See below for a detailed description.

**XYZ calibration is needed for the kit version** , the factory assembled printer is already calibrated.

XYZ calibration is a part of the **Wizard** , which will appear on the first boot or after a factory reset. In case you have skipped the Wizard, you can start it manually from the _LCD Menu - Calibration - Wizard._

If you wish to redo the XYZ calibration and you have finished the **Selftest** successfully, you can start the XYZ calibration separately through the _LCD Menu - Calibration - XYZ cal._

For

**MK3S+ printers, which have the SuperPINDA**

installed, you

**MUST use firmware version 3.9.2, or above!**

## Calibration walkthrough

1. The printer will start the calibration by aligning the Z-axis. **Make sure that both ends of the X-axis reached the top**.
2. In the next step, the printer asks whether you have the steel sheet on the heated bed. **R** **em** **ove the steel sheet for the upcoming initial 4 point calibration now and select No.**
3. Check that the **nozzle is clean** and confirm the on-screen prompt.
4. Place a sheet of paper (e.g. the included cheat sheet) between the nozzle and the heatbed. If the nozzle catches the paper, **immediately** press the **Reset button.** Your P.I.N.D.A. sensor is probably set too high. Lower it down by 2 - 3 threads and run the XYZ calibration again. More info below.



**Do not leave the printer unattended during this calibration, otherwise, you may end up with a scratched heatbed. The paper is just an indicator, not protection!!!**

5. Once the first routine finishes, **place the steel sheet on the heated bed and confirm the on-screen prompt**. The printer will perform a full 9 point mesh bed leveling. All of the measured compensations will be stored in non-volatile memory.



### Troubleshooting the XYZ calibration

Click here for explanations of [XYZ-calibration error-messages (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-error-messages-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_112340).

If you encounter any error messages, there is most likely something wrong with the assembly of your printer.

Please perform the following tasks:

1. Make sure you followed the instructions on the LCD precisely. Especially make sure that the X-axis moved to the very top. Otherwise, the Z-axis might be misaligned.
2. Make sure that the cable harness leading from the extruder, or zip ties securing it, does **not hit the cover of the EINSY RAMBo board** before it reaches the end of the X-axis.
3. Check the [E-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_28536). Make sure that the hotend is perfectly inserted in the extruder.


Make sure the heatsink is slotted into both slots (green arrows), the short side of the heaterblock is facing forward (orange ruler), with its wires running back alongside the left side of the heaterblock (blue arrow).

4. Make sure nothing blocks the movement of any of the axis. You can easily test that by moving the extruder or heatbed through **LCD Menu - Settings - Move axis (X/Y).** Simply move it from one end to the other and inspect the movement.
5. Make sure that your P.I.N.D.A. or SuperPINDA sensor is roughly 1 mm higher than the tip of the nozzle. Distancing the P.I.N.D.A. sensor is covered in the assembly manual Part [9\. Preflight check](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/9-preflight-check_36224).

6. There is also a small possibility that your P.I.N.D.A. sensor could be defective. The easiest way how to check that is to navigate to _LCD Menu - Support - Sensor info._ While placing anything metal (e.g. a spatula) under the P.I.N.D.A. sensor. The P.I.N.D.A. value should change from **0 to 1**. More information can be found in [P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA Sensor testing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/p-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing_2091).



If you have just recently updated your Firmware version and XYZ calibration is

**repeatedly**

failing without any apparent reason, we recommend doing a

# [First Layer Calibration (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364)

The First Layer Calibration is used to calibrate the distance between the tip of the nozzle and the print surface. The aim is to adjust the nozzle height until the extruded plastic sticks nicely to the bed and you can see that it is being slightly squished.

The printers assembled in the Prusa factory are already fine-tuned and this calibration is needed only in case you build the kit version at home or change the nozzle. The First Layer Calibration is part of the Wizard (last step of the XYZ-Calibration). You can also recalibrate the first layer later on from the _LCD-menu - Calibration - First Layer Calibration_. During this process, rotate the knob to manually adjust the distance between the nozzle and the bed, while the printer is printing a zig-zag pattern.

As

**each type of sheet (smooth, satin, and textured) has a different thickness**

you must use a different First layer calibration for each of them. For this, we have a convenient feature called

[Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955)

.

With a newly assembled printer, you will start at zero and move into a negative (-) value, reducing the distance between nozzle and heat bed. The initial zero-value is set by the P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA. position. **Turn the knob counter-clockwise to bring the nozzle closer to the bed and moving the value away from zero.** The value is unique to each printer and it may also slightly change with time and use. You must, therefore, **check visually when adjusting the height, not by a set value.**

The first layer calibration being set incorrectly can lead to various issues. With the nozzle too far from the print surface, you risk your print not sticking properly, which can result in a [blob](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extruder-blob_2005). On the other side, if set too close, you can experience extrusion problems and [clogging](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3-5-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008) and poor print quality, **or even damage to the hardware, like the[Flexible steel sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flexible-steel-sheets-guidepost_2195) due to the print sticking too much.** It is therefore **important to get this right.**

Before you proceed, make sure that the print surface (satin, smooth, or textured steel-sheet) is clean. You can find information on how to clean it in [PEI print surface preparation](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804). There are some small differences between how it should look on the textured and smooth steel sheet. We will, therefore, present pictures and guidelines for both, starting with the smooth sheet.

**Turn the knob counter-clockwise to bring the nozzle closer to the bed.**

### Smooth sheet

#### Too high

**You want the line flattened, but not squished.** On the square at the end of the test line, you do not want any **gaps between the lines ( left picture), which means it is too high. **In that case, the value will be too close to zero

#### Too low

If the nozzle is set too low (right picture) you will see the line squished completely flat and the end square will have **ridges between the lines, which is a clear sign it is set too low** and the value will be too far away from zero. When it is too low, the edges of the square can also start curling upwards. In the extreme, the filament will be spread so thin you will be able to see through the printed filament, leading to clogging of your hotend.

#### Just right

A correct adjustment will show you an even surface (center picture), with no gaps between lines, nor ridges. As stated, the numeric value depends on the exact position of the P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor, which will be unique to each machine and means nothing without a visual reference. **However, a common range is from -0.400 to -1.500.**

Adjusting it closer can in some cases improve adhesion. However, if you are having problems with adhesion, but your first layer calibration looks like the 'good' picture (center picture), your problem lies somewhere else, like a dirty/greasy sheet, print-settings, bed leveling/XYZ calibration, or under-extrusion.

**You can not use the same first layer calibration if you swap between the Smooth and the textured sheet!**

For more information, please see

[Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955)

.

### Textured sheet

The textured sheets are thinner than the sheets with smooth PEI, therefore you need to move the nozzle bit closer, but you are seeking the same results as with the smooth sheet. Again, if **it is set too low ( right picture) the filament can start curling up** around the edges like it is not adhering. The numeric value will be too far from zero and must be adjusted back.

If set too high, you will see the line being round, and have gaps between the lines of the end-square. In this case, the value is too close to zero.

### Have a look at the nozzle

A single layer is about 0.2 mm / 0.00787402 inch. Having a look at the nozzle and its distance to the sheet can also be helpful. However, measuring the printed layer with calipers is not a recommended method to calibrate the first layer.

### When to run the First layer calibration

Generally, the **first layer calibration** should be performed every time there is a **major change in the assembly.** This includes changing the nozzle, extruder upgrades, or other updates to any axis. You should also run all calibrations if you move the printer to a different location.

For First Layer Calibrations with other nozzle diameters than 0.4 mm, please see

[this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/different-nozzle-types_2193#first-layer-calibration-of-other-nozzles)

### Other issues

* If the width of the line varies across its length, you may have to do some [Bed Level Correction](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/bed-level-correction_2267).
* If the nozzle comes in contact with the bed, the SuperPINDA/P.I.N.D.A. leveling sensor is not being triggered by the flexible steel sheet and must be physically moved lower in its holder. This will bring it closer to the level of the nozzle tip. You should make sure it is adjusted as instructed in the [Preflight check](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/9-preflight-check_76792) in the Assembly manual. **If you move the leveling sensor you must redo the First layer calibration.**

# [Adjusting belt tension (MK3/MK3S/MK3S+/MK3.5/MK4)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mk3-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5-mk4_112380)

Loose belts would cause a printer to malfunction and prevent proper printing. It can cause [Layer shifting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layer-shifting_2020), [Ghosting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ghosting_1801), or other print abnormalities like getting an irregular shape instead of a perfect circle when printing a cylinder. **The Y-axis belt is located under the heatbed, X-axis belt moves the print head. All adjustments are done with the 2.5mm Allen key.**

### Checking belt tension

#### New procedure - Belt tuner app

For checking the belt tightness using our [belt tuner](https://belt.connect.prusa3d.com/), follow the instructions in the video below.

#### Old procedure

On MK3/S/+, run the Self-test or the Belt test, from Calibration on the LCD. Then check _LCD-menu - > Support -> Belt-status._ You want the number between **260 and 290 (275~)**. _The lower the number, the tighter the belt is. Imagine it is a fictive count of teeth in circulation._

Another way is to use the technique described in [this step](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_28536#30816) of the assembly manual to test if the pulley is correctly tightened and if the belt is not too loose. Hold the X-axis motor shaft with pliers (take advantage of the flat part of the shaft) to fix it in place ( **purple circle** ), then try to move the extruder by hand. **You should see no slack on the belt as a result of pushing on the extruder.** The same procedure can be applied to test the Y-axis pulley and belt.

### X-axis belt

#### Slight adjustments MK3S

Loosen the two front-facing screws and make sure they have space to their right to move ( **yellow circles** ). While assisting with the rotation of the motor with your hand, tighten the M3x18 screw on top of the X-end-motor ( **purple arrow** ).

After each turn or two check the tension in the belt by pressing them together. For optimal performance, the belt must need some force to press together with your fingers (green arrows). **Move the extruder all the way to the X-end-idler and try the belt tension in the middle of the X-axis.**

#### Slight adjustments MK3S+, MK3.5, MK3.9, MK4

1. Slightly release all the screws holding the motor, otherwise, the "tensioner" won't work as the motor must be able to move (left picture).
2. Using the ball end of the Allen key, start tightening the screw on the rear side of the X-end-motor, but after each turn or two check the tension in the belt (right picture).
3. When you achieve optimal tension, please tighten the screws again (left picture).



#### Large adjustments MK3/S/+ or MK3.5

If a slight adjustment is not sufficient you must adjust it at the belt holder. This is found on the back of the extruder and requires a little disassembly.

First, remove the two top screws from the motor-holder to let the belt have some slack in order to easier manipulate the belt.

1. Snip the zip-ties on the back of the extruder ( **red arrows** ), which are securing the hotend wires **and** the ones securing the cable wrap.


2. Unscrew the 4 screws circled in the picture below.


3. Carefully pull the back plate loose, making sure the wires are safe, and turn the whole plate to the left or right.


4. You now have access to where you mount the belts. Put a mark on the belt with a pen or marker as close to the plastic part as possible, so you know how it was adjusted. Now, take out the belt from the mount and move it in 1-2 teeth.



It may be necessary to cut off the last tooth of the belt.

5. Place the back plate back on, secure the screws, starting with the center one for alignment, then put on new zip-ties.
6. Re-tighten the screws on the x-motor, securing it. Adjust it tighter if needed.



#### Large adjustments MK3.9 / MK4

1. Loosen the three indicated screws covering the X-carriage. Carefully take out the X-cover-back.
2. You now have access to where you mount the belt. Put a mark on the belt with a pen or marker as close to the plastic part as possible, so you know how it was adjusted. Now, take out the belt from the mount and move it in 1-2 teeth.



### Y-axis belt

#### Slight adjustments

On the front plate of the printer's frame, behind the LCD module, you will find the printed Y-axis belt idler. This is held by two M3X10 screws ( **purple arrow** ), going through the front plate.

If you have a gap between the idler part and the front plate of the frame ( **blue arrows** ) you can tighten the belt by using your 2.5 mm Allen key to turn the screws clockwise ( **purple arrow** ), closing the gap.

The easiest way to access the screws is from below, by moving the printer to the edge of its table, with the LCD module sticking out. You now have access to the bolts from below the LCD module.

#### Large adjustments

If a slight adjustment is not sufficient you must adjust it at the belt holder. There are two main types of the Y-axis belt holder, one adjustable and one fixed. The adjustable belt holder was introduced in the first quarter of 2019, with the S-upgrade for the Original Prusa MK3, and is also featured on the Original Prusa MK4. Adjustments for this are explained in ' **Method 1** '. For an earlier Original Prusa MK3, follow ' **Method 2** ', for the fixed belt holder.

#### Method 1 - Adjustable belt holder

The Original Prusa MK4 has a different design than in the pictures, but the procedure is the same.

1. Unplug the printer and lay it over on the side of the PSU.
2. Below the bed carriage, you will find the belt holder. Loosen the right screw by turning it **counterclockwise** ( **orange circle** left picture).
3. Turn the screw going through the two halves of the belt holder ( **purple arrow** right picture). Turn **clockwise** to tighten the belt, moving the two halves together ( **blue arrows** ).
4. When at the correct tension, secure the right half of the belt holder again by turning the screw from step 2 clockwise ( **orange circle** left picture).



#### Method 2 - Fixed belt holder

1. Unplug the printer and lay it over on the side of the PSU.
2. Detach the belt-idler in order to easier manipulate the belt ( **purple arrows** ). _Detaching the idler completely may not be necessary, but will make it easier to adjust the belt in the next step._


3. Set a mark on the belt so you know how much you are moving it. Now take out the belt of the top slot, and move it in 1-2 teeth ( **blue arrow** ) before pushing it back into the slot ( **green arrows** ).



_Your belt mount may look slightly different, being another iteration, but the procedure remains the same._

4. Re-attach the belt-idler with its two M3x10 screws through the frame ( **purple arrow** ). Leave a gap with the frame, for slight adjustments ( **blue arrows** ).

# [XYZ Calibration (MK2/S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-mk2-s_112396)

XYZ calibration is a procedure that will tell you how well you have assembled your printer. Essentially, it measures the skew of your X/Y axis and compensates for any imperfections. It may indicate two sets of error messages **[compromised/failed].** See below for a detailed description.

**Make sure the Z-axis is moved all the way to the top.**

### Calibration walkthrough

During the initial process, only four main points are being measured - **Front, Right, Rear and Left.**

In the second round, all **nine points** are being measured. All of the compensations are then stored in non-volatile memory. This routine is called **Mesh-bed leveling.**

If you ended up with "XYZ Calibration / Bed leveling failed..." please follow the instructions below.

### Improving calibration

If you encounter any of these error messages, then there is usually something wrong with the assembly of your printer.

**Go through the following tasks:**

1. Make sure that you have followed the instructions on the LCD screen precisely. Especially make sure that your X-axis was moved to the very top. Otherwise, your X-axis might not be perfectly level.
2. Make sure there is nothing blocking or reducing the movement of any of the axes, like:
1.       * Unlubricated smooth rods/bearings.
* Pulleys are secure, aligned, and free of any filament debris.
* Belt tension too tight or too loose.
3. Double-check that there's a 100mm (3.937inches) distance between the Y-corners and the frame.

4. Navigate to **LCD menu - Calibration - Auto-home.** The P.I.N.D.A. sensor must stop right in the center of the 1st and also the last calibration point (please refer to photos below). Also, make sure that the P.I.N.D.A. sensor is roughly 1mm higher than the tip of the nozzle.

5. It is rather unlikely, but there is a small possibility that your P.I.N.D.A. sensor could be defective. The easiest way to check for potential issues is to go to the **LCD Menu - Calibration - Show endstops.** While placing anything metal (e.g. a spatula) under the P.I.N.D.A. sensor. The endstop reading should change from **0 to 1**. More information can be found in [P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA Sensor testing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/p-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing_2091).



**If your PINDA sensor did not end up perfectly within the circle**

, it means that there is a shift on the X/Y axis. For detailed information on how to proceed please see

[Misaligned PINDA Sensor (MK2/S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/misaligned-pinda-sensor-mk2-s_2016)

.

If you have just recently updated your Firmware version, and XYZ calibration is failing without any logical reason, go to **LCD Menu - Calibration - Reset calibration**. Once it's done, simply restart the calibration process and see if it makes any difference.

#### **Initial XYZ Calibration error messages**

_"XYZ calibration_ _**failed**_ _. Bed calibration point was not found."
_ **= Printer was unable to perfectly locate the initial calibration point.**

_"XYZ calibration failed. Please consult the manual."_

**= Calibration point was not found at all.**

# [Live adjust Z](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/live-adjust-z_112427)

Every FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) printer requires a First Layer Calibration, which **sets the vertical "Z" distance between the nozzle and the print surface**. Sometimes this value needs **a slight adjustment** and for this situation, there is an option called " **Live adjust Z"** _(as you are mostly tuning it live during the first layers of your print)._ The reason for adjusting the distance is to **provide better adhesion** of the extruded filament.

### **How does it work?**

It is important to know the following:

* the default value before the First layer calibration starts at zero (0.000) for all printers
* to get **closer to the print surface** , turn the knob **counter-clockwise** and further **increase the negative value** (e.g. -0.500 => -0.600 => -0.700...)
* to get **further from the print surface** , turn the knob **clockwise** and continue **lowering the negative value** (e.g. -0.700 => -0.600 => -0.500...)



The values of the _Live adjust Z_ are typically in the range of -1.500 to -0.200. Going above zero into the positive values is not possible, this indicates either an issue with the measuring sensor (M.I.N.D.A., P.I.N.D.A., SuperPINDA) or incorrect alignment.

The correctly assembled print head has **the sensor always slightly above the nozzle** , never at an equal level or below the nozzle (see the picture below). _The exact position can slightly vary, use the last chapter of the assembly manual of your printer to set the rough distance._

_Example of the MK3S extruder_

### Live Adjust Z (while printing)

The most common approach is to perform the _Live Adjust Z_ during the print. Go to _LCD Menu - >_ _Live adjust Z._ This will show the _Live adjust Z_ value you have set in the First layer calibration. From here you can adjust it by rotating the knob.

PRO tip: shortcut from the main screen, while printing the first few layers press and hold the knob for a few seconds to access the

_Live adjust Z_

screen.

**Adjusting Live adjust Z value while printing is permanent**

, not only for the ongoing print! The new value will also remain after you turn OFF the printer.

In the picture below you can see examples of different _Live adjust Z_ values. If the nozzle is too high from the surface, the filament won't stick properly (left), if the nozzle is too close to the surface, the filament won't be able to "flow out" leading to a potential clog of the nozzle (right).

### Live Adjust Z (before the print)

You can also change the value while the printer is at rest from _LCDMenu - > Settings -> Live adjust Z._ You will see the value set previously during the First layer calibration, and from here you can adjust it by rotating the knob.

**The Live adjust Z should be used only to fine-tune the distance**. For example, PETG and other high-temperature materials require to be squished in the surface slightly more as they tend to warp (lift up), compared to the PLA. If you have replaced the sensor or disassembled the print head (extruder) you should run the [First Layer Calibration (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364) instead.

### Live Adjust Z (LoadCell)

The **Original Prusa MK4, MK3.9** and the Original Prusa XL are equipped with a LoadCell, which will calibrate the first layer automatically. In case you would still like to fine-tune it, you can long-press the knob while the first layer is printed. The Live Adjust Z will not be saved for the next print in this case.

In case you have constant issues with the first layer on a Prusa printer with the Loacell, check the guide [First layer issues](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804).

# [Preheat error bed #12201 (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/preheat-error-bed-12201-mini_112444)

### What happened?

A printer displaying the message **"Preheat error bed"** encountered an error while heating up the heatbed. If the heatbed temperature does not increase more than 2 ºC for 240 seconds, the printer starts a safety feature, which instantly kills the heating process and displays the message on the screen. The printer then waits for the user to inspect all parts and if needed fix the issue.

Error name: Preheat error bed

### How to fix it?

The inability to heat up the heatbed might indicate some issue with the wiring, either the heater or the thermistor cables are possibly damaged.

#### A visual inspection

Before breaking out the multimeter you should check the heatbed, where the thermistor and heater resides, that no wires have broken off the sensor or heater themselves. While the printer is turned off, carefully try to move the wires by hand. If any of them have come detached your search is over and the part needs to be changed. **It is not recommended to solder these wires,** moreover, for the thermistor, it will change it's resistance and thus readings. Spare parts can be found in our e-shop, or you can contact [Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) for assistance.

Also, make sure everything is connected to the Buddy mainboard, inside its case. Loosen the one screw securing the cover (circled in the picture below), remove the top cable cover and flip it open to reveal the board.

Check that all the connectors are secure in their sockets, according to the picture below. Focus on the thermistor and heater cables (yellow arrows). Though unlikely, rough shipping or handling could have shaken the heater or thermistor cables loose.

#### Checking the resistance

The table below describes the correct resistance for each part, as well as what scale you should set your meter to. **We have another more in-depth guide on[Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117).** All thermistors are rated to be **100 kΩ at 25 °C.** To be realistic, with a varying temperature between 20 °C and 30 **°** C, **you can expect a wider range of readings (~85-105 kΩ), than with the heater.**

There can be micro-fractures in the cable, breaking the connections only at certain positions. Therefore, try to move the cable a bit while doing the measurement and see if the value changes drastically.

##### Part

##### Resistance

##### Multimeter scale

Thermistors (Bed and hotend)

**The part should be cold (room temperature) and unplugged when measuring the resistance!**

#### Where to measure

For every component, there are several options, our main focus will be on the connectors. The measurement appears on the multimeter LCD as soon as the measurement probes touch the component. To obtain the correct and relevant values, this is where you need to apply the probes:

* **Thermistors:** metal inserts in plastic connectors


* **Heater cables:** screws holding the cables in the connector

# [Types of printers and their differences](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/types-of-printers-and-their-differences_112464)

3D printing is an automated additive manufacturing-process, where a 3D printer creates a physical model based on digital data (a 3D object). All types of 3D printing are based on the same principle: creating objects by adding layers on top of (or below) existing layers. As of this moment, there is no 3D printing technology that would be completely universal and suitable for every purpose. This is why it's important to decide how and for what purpose you are going to use the printer.

### FDM/FFF printers

**FDM** is an acronym for **Fused Deposition Modeling** (trademark by Stratasys) and **FFF** stands for **Fused Filament Fabrication** (open source). It encompasses all 3D printers, which heat/melt polymers and push it through a nozzle/extruder/print head onto a platform, where the model is built. The material for printing is provided as filament spools of 1.75 mm or occasionally 2.85 mm in diameter. The differences in the types of printers out there lay in how the extruder and print platform move to create the models.

#### Cartesian printers

Cartesian printers are characterized by at least three motors moving the parts of the printer along the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system: Y (back and forth), X (left and right), and Z (up and down). Most personal desktop printers are Cartesian printers due to them being very widespread and low cost

The model to be printed needs to be sliced into layers for the print. The Y- and X-axis will define the coordinates to be printed in one layer, and once the layer is ready the Z-axis will make the nozzle move one layer up, either by moving the print-bed or by moving the extruder. If overhangs are present, supports can be added below them.

The biggest advantage of the Cartesian printers is how common they are. There are a lot of tips, tricks, and solutions for issues online. The parts for the printer can also be found easily.

On the downside, Cartesian printers, if used for faster prints, will have a lower quality of printing due to the weight of the axes. Also, usually, the printer volume is a lot larger than the build volume due to the movement of all of the axes.

#### CoreXY printers

Like the Cartesian printers, the CoreXY design also has the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates determined by two motors and timing belts on the Y- and X-axis, and the print height determined by the Z-axis. The difference of the Core XY is that the X and Y movement is dependent on each other, done by a very specific belt design. The print surface, in this case, will be lifted to meet the extruder. Note that not only the movable print surface makes a CoreXY printer. The defining trait for the printer type is the design of the XY-belts and their movement.

Since the X and Y axes are a lot lighter, faster prints will not have the artifacts that may appear on fast prints on Cartesian printers. The design also allows for a lot larger part of its overall volume to be the build-volume, since there is no need for the print surface to move sideways.

The belts used in CoreXY printers are a lot longer, which makes all belt issues bigger than with the Cartesian printers. Their complicated path also makes these issues harder to repair. The frame needs to be very stable and perfectly square, or else the dimensional accuracy will be smaller.

#### Delta printers

In Delta printers, the print surface stands still, and three motors work together to meet in the hotend and move it with the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, as well as the height of it. These motors control three posts, and these posts are connected to the extruder by arms that will move the hotend. The name of the printer style (delta = Δ) comes from the triangular shape which the arms holding the hotend form. This type of printer was designed to make faster prints.

The Delta printer extruder is very light. That combined with the 3 motors controlling it, makes this printer ideal for fast prints. This printer was an early adopter of the 32-bit system due to the complex calculation it takes to make the movements. Some of the attraction of the printer is also how cool it looks while it is working.

The Delta printers all have a relatively small and circular print surface. This limits the build-space significantly. The high speed of the printer makes the prints less precise. Also, it is uncommon to be used as a desktop printer, as any issues that the printer has can be extremely difficult to troubleshoot and fix, not only due to complex working and lack of information but the overall lack and cost of parts. The printer also needs to work with a Bowden extruder to make the extruder light, which can limit the number of filaments that can be used.

#### Polar printers

This printer uses the Polar coordinate system, which has the points on a circular grid instead of the square as the Cartesian system. The printing platform not only moves sideways but it also rotates. This allows the extruder to only move up and down, and also for a large build area. This printer has a very light frame.

This technology is still being developed. That makes the printer very expensive, and it makes parts and technical support hard to find when you have problems.

### SLA

#### (Stereolithography)

The basic principle of _vat polymerization printing_ is that a vat containing photosensitive liquid (resin) is cured layer by layer, by a heat source to make the object.

Printed objects are almost perfectly smooth, incredibly detailed and layers are nearly invisible to the human eye, with the minimal layer height going from 25 – 100 microns. The biggest disadvantage of this technology can be a smaller print surface area and also the toxicity of liquid resins. You should try to prevent resins from touching your skin and avoid inhaling resin vapors.

Printed objects are not fit for immediate use after the print job finishes since they tend to be a bit soft and sticky - which is caused by the leftover unsolidified resin on the surface of the object. It is recommended to wash the object in isopropyl alcohol and to cure it further using UV light.

#### Masked Stereolithography (MSLA)

Each layer's shape is displayed as a semi-transparent mask on an LCD screen, and the exposure is performed employing a high-performance UV LED. UV light can pass only through white pixels on the display. Due to the fixed resolution of the LCD display, the printed objects have a fixed XY resolution. This method also cures a whole layer at a time, meaning it doesn’t matter how many objects there are on the printing platform.

#### Stereolithography (SLA)

Exposure is performed by a UV laser ray. The ray is controlled by two mirrors and it “draws” each layer gradually. The time required to solidify a single layer depends on the size of the area which needs to be solidified. Simply put, the more objects there are on the print platform, the longer the print takes.

#### Direct/digital Light Processing (DLP)

The whole layer is solidified at once thanks to a digital projector. The areas that receive exposure from the projector are solidified. The advantage of this method is obvious - each layer is solidified in the same amount of time, no matter how many objects there are on the print platform.

### SLS

**Selective Laser Sintering**

Another type of 3D printing technology is SLS and DMLS, which use a process called _sintering_. Essentially, every time a new layer is printed, a cylinder spreads a thin layer of fine powder across the platform, which is then sintered with a laser into the required shape. When the print is finished, the whole object is covered with the printing powder. Due to how this method works, the printed objects must have holes, through which the excessive powder is poured out. Unsintered material can be reused for the next prints, which means that very little material is wasted. Another advantage is the fact that the layers are nearly invisible. These printers are not massively widespread among the common public. Due to their main use in various industries, the prices are noticeably higher - the cheapest machines start at around 6000 USD.

There are other types of technology and designs out there, like "Jetting" or concrete and metal printers, using various methods. Since those are mostly reserved for industrial applications due to price and patents, they are not included here.

# [Hotend disassembly & heatbreak stuck in the heatsink](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hotend-disassembly-heatbreak-stuck-in-the-heatsink_112677)

This guide is for the E3D V6 Hotend on the MK-series.

**NOT FOR THE PRUSA MINI!**

You can find the complete [E3Ds assembly manual of the V6 hotend](https://wiki.e3d-online.com/E3D-v6_Assembly), which can be followed backward for disassembly. **This is the stock hotend on an Original Prusa MK3S/MK2.5S/MK2S.** However, as the manual works with brand new parts, it does not consider the changes that happen when being heated repeatedly to hundreds of degrees, again and again. Metal contracts and expands and thermal paste will turn crusty over time. Therefore there are some changes to the procedure when disassembling after a long time of use.

### Disassembly

The [assembly manual for the V6](https://wiki.e3d-online.com/E3D-v6_Assembly) is still optimal for most of this procedure, with a few exceptions. Moving backward, you are first removing the nozzle (at 280 °C) to release the heatbreak. However, this makes it harder to remove the heatbreak from the heat sink in later steps.

As the heatbreak can be quite fragile, and its threads me be damaged if you try to grip it with pliers, **we recommend that you unscrew the heatsink from the heatbreak, before removing the nozzle,** which locks the heatbreak in place. A Heatbreak can still bend and break so do not unscrew it at an angle. A bend will create a whole range of printing issues.

After you have unscrewed the heat sink from the heatbreak, proceed with the E3Ds assembly manual, by heating the block and unscrewing the nozzle.

### Too late, it is already stuck!

Follow this procedure to resolve the issue.

1. Without any heat, manually screw your nozzle into its threaded hole in the heater block.
2. Screw it all the way in, then loosen it back a full turn (as described in step 3 of the E3D V6 Hotend assembly) creating a gap of about 1mm between nozzle and block.
3. Then screw the heatbreak, with the attached heatsink, into the heatblock from the other side as far as it will go.
4. Tighten the nozzle with a pair of pliers and you now have a better handle. You can also grab this with pliers for some leverage when unscrewing the stuck heatsink.

# [Modifier-meshes: Custom supports and other magic](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/modifier-meshes-custom-supports-and-other-magic_114258)

This will be covered more extensively in the near future, but for now, we want to give you a quick overview on how to use some of the amazing new features available in PrusaSlicer. This guide sums up using primitives (cubes, spheres, cylinders, etc.) to affect selected regions of your 3d-model in different ways, be it various infill, perimeters, or custom supports.

### Modifier meshes

**Modifier meshes apply custom settings to the intersection of the modifier mesh and the model.**

**Right-click** on a model and pick **Add modifier - [Select modifier type]**. When you pick the modifier shape (e.g. cube) it will appear in the 3D view and in the Object list in the right panel.

You can either right-click on the modifier in the 3D view or click on the gear icon in the Object list panel to generate modifier-meshes.

Choosing "Add part" from the same list will create an object that will be sliced as the model, but can be moved in the Z-axis as well.

There are 4 primitives to choose from - Cube, Cylinder, Sphere, and Slab. Additionally, in the expert mode, you can **use any STL-file as a modifier-mesh** by selecting **Load …** in the mesh selection. This mesh is typically something you’ve modeled beforehand in a 3D-modelling program.

You can use the familiar **Move, Rotate, and Scale-** tools to transform the modifier-mesh.

Some settings are only available in **Advanced and Expert-mode** : **Advanced mode** \- custom infill, layers, and perimeters or support material **Expert mode** \- custom infill, layers, and perimeters, support material, extrusion width, speed, and several other settings

If you scale the model then both model and modifier-mesh will scale. Modifier-mesh will retain its size and position relative to the model.

### Custom supports

Using custom supports is the same approach as modifier-meshes, where you instead choose "Add Support enforcers" for applying supports and "Add Support Blockers" to remove supports in certain areas. Supports will be generated to where the Enforcer intersects with the main model. **Be sure to enable support enforcers,** in the drop-down menu found above your list of models.

If you select "Support on built-plate only" or "Everywhere" only Support blockers can be utilized.

### Height range modifier

**Right-click** on a model and pick the **Height range modifier** from the same context menu you added the modifier-mesh or Support enforcer/blocker. A new window will appear in the right panel called **Height ranges**. Here you set intervals, between which you can apply different settings. When you set an interval, it will appear in the Object list in the right panel.

You can add or remove intervals with the orange **plus** and **minus** icons.

When you click on the gear icon next to the interval, you can choose to set up:

* **Advanced mode** \- custom infill, layers, and perimeters or support material
* **Expert mode** \- custom infill, layers and perimeters, support material, extrusion width, speed, and several other settings



The interval setting also features a **layer height input**. By default, the global layer-setting is used, but you can choose to slice the model at a different layer height and only the interval will be affected by this change. Keep in mind that if you set up a different layer height for the entire model, on the height interval it will be overridden by this value.

### Modeling using PrusaSlicer

These features essentially enable you to do modeling/remixing using only PrusaSlicer. Below is an example where a Tartasauro, by Thingiverse-user 'gianpaolo', has been hollowed out and made into "Piggy-bank" using only the features explained here. The threading and screw-cap at the bottom are both the same model, found online. Void and coin-slot are primitives generated by PrusaSlicer, with infill, perimeters, and top/bottom-layers set to zero.

Download the .3mf project-file

[here](https://files.helpdocs.io/Sd0njU6Ihj/other/1579269917594/tartasauro-0-15-mm-pla-mk.3mf)

# [Heatbed connection resistance analysis (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/heatbed-connection-resistance-analysis-mini_114422)

We want to thank the community for bringing out potential issues and we address every safety-concern very seriously. We take full responsibility for our machines in case something happens, and we are insured for any such case. Every time we discover concerns from our users on the internet, we sum up our measurements and share them with you.

### Summary

MINI’s bed (with 3.6A of current) is significantly smaller than the MK3 (with 7A of current), rendering the power flowing into the bed roughly at ½. The resistance of the full connection, including mounting bolts, are 7 m? for MINI and 4 m? for MK3S. It renders a power loss on the connection of 170 mW for MINI and 430 mW for MK3S (For comparison the resistor for the heatbed LED produces 250mW of heat). This shows that the heat generated at the connector is 2.5 times lower than on the MK3, providing even higher failure safety-margin than before. Terminals are secured with nyloc nuts, which do stay in place even in very rough conditions.

In conclusion, the only aspect we see as troubling is the appearance, which at first sight might look it’s missing the contact pads on the bottom side of the board, which are however not needed, as full connection must happen on the top side of the board. With our experience and safety track-record we stand by the MINI's design and it is safe.

### Measurements

Average measured Power loss in the heatbed connection:

MINI is 170 mW, MK3S is 430 mW

Average measured resistance of one heatbed connection terminal:

MINI is 7 m?, MK3S is 4 m?

This fact is because power rises with a square of current and linearly with resistance. The normal running current of the MINI heatbed is 3.6 A, MK3S is 7 A, this makes a huge difference, For comparison, power loss on resistor for LED is 220 mW.

The following thermal-image shows a comparison of the LED resistor with the connection and its surroundings

Due to measured values, we can confirm that there is a slight increase in resistance but due to lower running current, we are certain that it's not an issue. We can confirm that even our oldest MINI printers from the early stages of development do not show any measurable connection resistance increase over time.

We used two different methods of measurements:

* Standard 4 wire measurement of low resistance using Keysight measuring just the connection resistance


* Specialized tester for pre-compliance testing of grid-connected devices REVEX plus measuring the whole path of one conductor from the bed connector to the copper pad (Which was showing larger values due to specification of the method and device limitations)



Measured values from method No 2:

# [Elephant foot compensation](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/elephant-foot-compensation_114487)

This option is not available when PrusaSlicer is in

[Simple mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

.

When printing **the first layer** is squished against the heated print bed and as a result, it’s usually **a bit wider than it should be.**

For many applications, this might not be an issue. But if you have something that really needs to have precise dimensions or fit together with very tight tolerances, it can be a problem.

_Without the Elephant foot compensation, the first layer may be wider than expected_

Instead of having to sand this slight edge off, this setting will scale/shrink the first layer.

You'll find it under **Print settings - Advanced - Elephant foot compensation.** To access this setting, PrusaSlicer must be in Advanced or Expert mode.

Values around

**0.2 mm**

usually work well for the default 0.4 mm nozzle.

PrusaSlicer automatically detects

**thin lines**

in the first layer and makes sure not to over shrink them. This detection is present in PrusaSlicer 2.2 and newer.

Official **Prusa profiles** have this setting **turned on** by default.

#### Brim doesn't connect to the model with Elephant foot compensation turned on

This is on purpose. The elephant foot compensation compensates for the squish, which **is not visualized in the preview**. In reality, the gap will be filled in by the squished-out material. Though it is true, that the brim will have a weaker connection to the model with the elephant foot compensation turned on.

If the brim doesn't connect to the part when printed, you likely have Elephant foot compensation set too high.

#### The first layer seems deformed in the preview

A side effect of the Adaptive elephant foot compensation is a possible distortion in spots where thin features connect to bigger parts of the model. This distortion is mainly pronounced in the preview (in reality, the squish of the first layer will fill more area than shown) and only affects the first layer. Still, if this is an issue for you, turn the Elephant compensation off (turn it to 0).

# [How to replace a M.I.N.D.A. sensor (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-m-i-n-d-a-sensor-mini_115145)

-

Before covering the electronics, make sure the square nut is correctly positioned in the printed part. **The nut must not fall out!** This can cause fatal damage to the electronics.

- Insert the cover back in, make sure it is properly seated in the holes.

-  **Place the second cover on the top and arrange the cables:**

-  **Extruder bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially in. Also, it must be tilted away from the printer.

-  **Heatbed bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially inside the box.

-  **Filament sensor cable** (optional), ensure that the textile sleeve wrapped around the cables is partially inside the box.

- Now, tighten the second cover. Check that no cable is pinched.

# [Hollowing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hollowing_117285)

All objects sliced for the SLA printers are **completely solid** by default. There is **no infill pattern** like in FFF/FDM 3D printing. Solid objects printed from the liquid resin can be heavy and robust, but the resin consumption is high compared to hollow objects, especially when printing large models.

Hollowing out your 3D model is a great way to:

* save a considerable amount of **material** (lowers the print price)
* lower the **surface area of each layer** \- which decreases the force needed to detach the print from the display when moving to the next layer
* reduce the **number of needed supports** (lower weight of printed model)



We suggest adding at least two **drainage holes**. Without them, the uncured resin would end up being trapped inside your finished print.

You need **PrusaSlicer 2.2 or newer** to access the Hollowing tool.

Hollowing can be configured for each model individually using the Hollowing tool in the **left toolbar**. Alternatively, you can configure hollowing for all models at once in **Print Settings - Hollowing**.

The hollowing and drainage hole workflow is **non-destructive**. Hollowing can be canceled and drainage holes can be moved or removed at any time.

The model hollowing is configured with the following parameters:

#### **Hollowing thickness**

The thickness of the resulting shell. The minimum value is 1 mm.

#### **Hollowing accuracy**

A trade-off between accuracy and performance. If a low hollowing accuracy is set, the resulting model wall thickness may be uneven. Therefore a higher hollowing accuracy is recommended for a small hollowing thickness (for thin shells) to ensure minimum wall thickness.

#### **Hollowing closing distance**

Hollowing suppresses cavities narrower than the closing distance threshold, and it also fills in sharp concave corners of the inner wall, from which it would otherwise be difficult to remove the uncured highly viscous resin.

### Adding drainage holes

Drainage holes can be added by **left-clicking** on the object when the SLA hollowing gizmo is active.

The holes can later be repositioned by dragging them on the mesh.

Each hole is always perpendicular to the surface and its **diameter** and **depth** can be configured - the current settings will be used for newly placed holes.

You can remove holes by **right-clicking** on any of them.

**You can add holes even to models that have hollowing disabled**

. This is useful for models that you have hollowed in an external program.

If you need to input an exact value or the slider does not have enough range for your, you can **Ctrl+Left click** the value to edit it.

Please understand that if the input mesh is broken, the hole drilling algorithm may refuse to proceed in order to prevent program crashes or incorrect results.

### Confirm and preview the hollowed mesh

The hollowing and hole-drilling are performed after the **_Preview hollowed and drilled model_** button is pressed. Note that both hollowing and hole-drilling are computationally expensive tasks and will take some time, especially with complex models. In case the user does not press the button himself, the hollowing and drilling will be performed during the slicing process.

The **Clipping plane tool** can be used to peek inside an object (the same tool is present in the SLA support points editing gizmo). Move the slider from left to right to move the clipping plane. You can review the hollowed geometry and place the drainage holes appropriately.

The **Reset direction** button will align the clipping plane tool parallel to the current camera view. E.g. if you want to have the clipping plane moving up-down, look at the model from the top ( **Top view** 1 ) and hit the Reset direction button.

The Reset direction button is only visible if you move the Clipping plane tool to a non-zero value.

You can export the hollowed and drilled model by selecting

**File - Export - Export plate as STL.**

Changing a parameter will force an invalidation of the mesh (such as moving a hole, scaling the object, etc.). The model visualization reverts to the original object without the holes drilled and without the hollowing applied.

**Solid vs hollowed model example**

Solid model: 237 ml, $13.75 resin cost

Hollowed model: 81 ml, $4.70 resin cost

_Hellboy bust model by fotismint_

The hollowing and hole drilling features rely on

[OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/)

and

[CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/)

libraries. Many thanks to the authors of the two libraries.

# [How to replace a hotend PTFE tube (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-ptfe-tube-mini-mini_119449)

- Mount the "lower" fitting to the top of the heatsink. Screw it all the way, but don't tighten it. As soon as you reach the end of the thread, release it by a full turn (360 °).

**Pay attention to the correct orientation of the fitting**

. Insert the coarse-threaded side into the heatsink.

- Push the heaterblock up against the fitting with a reasonable force. No need to bend the entire axis. This will pre-stress the PTFE tube inside. **Now, it is important to keep the slight upwards pressure.**

- Make sure the heaterblock is aligned with the heatsink. If not, realign it, but keep the pressure.

- While holding the heaterblock from below (pressing the tube inside), tighten all three grub screws.

- Now, you can release the heaterblock. Make sure it doesn't move. If so, the grub screws were not tightened properly. Release them and return to the beginning of this step.

**It is crucial there is no gap**

between the PTFE tube and other parts of the hotend. This is why we are "pre-stressing" it.

# [Reload from disk](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/reload-from-disk_120427)

This feature is great for cases, where you created **a newer version of your model** and you wish to replace the old version in PrusaSlicer without having to set up things like custom supports or modifier meshes all over again.

**Right-click** on a model in the 3D view and choose **Reload from disk** from the context menu.

Alternatively, you can click on the

_editing_

icon in the object list (right side).

Reload from disk works even on

**custom modifier meshes**

, which you can add in the Expert mode.

_Two ways to access the Reload from disk function_

### Reload from disk in 3MF files

When you re-open a 3MF project file, you can still choose to reload any of the models.

By default, 3MF project files are configured to not save the full path to the source models, as this can pose a security risk when sharing such a file. If the full path is not saved and **Reload from disk** is requested, PrusaSlicer will ask for the location of the source file.

**Why is saving of full paths turned off by default?**
3MF is basically a zip archive, which contains human-readable XML files, thumbnail image and some miscellaneous files. The fact that the XML files are human-readable is one of the advantages of the 3MF file format. However, in some cases you might not want to reveal the location of your model files, e.g:
_C:MyCompanyNameMySecretProjectNamefriend_name_gift.stl_

# [Insert pause or custom G-code at layer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/insert-pause-or-custom-g-code-at-layer_120490)

### Insert pause at layer

Inserting a pause at a certain height can be used to insert magnets, weights or nuts into your prints. When you resume the print, these inserted objects will get covered by the following layers.

1. A pause can be inserted from the **Preview** window
2. Drag the **layer slider** on the right to select the target layer
3. **Right-click** on the orange plus icon
4. Select **Insert pause print (M601)**
* The pause will be inserted **before** the selected layer is being printed
5. Insert a short message to be displayed on the printer LCD when the print is paused
* e.g. “ _Place bearings in slots and resume printing_ ”
6. Confirm the Pause by hitting **OK**



You can **remove** the pause by moving the slider to the pause layer and left-clicking on the grey cross icon.

You can **edit** the pause message by right-clicking on the grey cross icon.

You need PrusaSlicer 2.2 or newer to access the Insert pause and Insert custom G-code function.

Both of these features **do not** work if you have [Sequential printing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sequential-printing_124589) enabled.

This feature is also not supported in old printer firmwares (on the MK3/S/+ you need at least fw 3.9.1).

When you slice the print again with inserted print pauses, you’ll get

**time estimates till each pause**

. The printer will also signal the pause with a beep.

When inserting

**magnets**

, they need to be firmly in their slots. Otherwise, they’ll get stuck to the print head as it passes over them. Either design the slots with a tight tolerance or use a small

**drop of super glue**

to hold them in place.

### Insert custom G-code at layer

Inserting custom G-code can be useful for **advanced users** when creating calibration G-code like a temperature tower.

"With great power comes great responsibility"

Verify twice that you inserted the right G-codes and that you understand what they do. For example, with some G-codes you could accidentally override the EEPROM values or move the nozzle into the print bed.

1. A custom G-code can be inserted from the **Preview** window
2. Drag the **layer slider** on the right to select the target layer
3. **Right-click** on the orange plus icon
4. Select **Add custom G-code**
* The custom G-code will be inserted **before** the selected layer is being printed
5. Insert the custom G-code into the newly opened window. You can add **several commands at once** , simply press Enter to insert a new line
6. Confirm by hitting **OK**



You can **remove** the custom G-code by moving the slider to the target layer and left-clicking on the grey cross icon.

You can **edit** the custom G-code by right-clicking on the grey cross icon.

#### Most commonly used Custom G-code commands

[M104 - Set Hotend Temperature](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M104.html)


M104 S260 ; set the current hotend temperature to 260 degrees

You can use this command to create a temperature tower by changing the hotend temperature at various layers.

[M109 - Wait for Hotend Temperature](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M109.html)


M109 S260 ; wait for the hotend to reach 260 degrees before proceeding

If the temperature is set with the letter S then M109 waits only when heating. If the temperature is set with the letter R then M109 will also wait for the temperature to go down.

# [Export SD/USB flash drive](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/export-sd-usb-flash-drive_120549)

PrusaSlicer automatically detects if you insert an SD card, USB flash drive, or other removable media.

When detected, a new **Export to SD/USB drive button** will appear next to the Export G-code button (bottom right corner). Clicking it will open the file save dialog with the path initialized to the SD card or USB flash drive.

If multiple SD cards or USB flash drives are detected, the file dialog is opened at the **last visited removable media**.

Once a G-code is exported to a removable media, an **Eject** button is shown next to the **Export G-code** button, which will safely disconnect your device.

# [How to replace a hotend fan (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-fan-mini_120913)

- Before covering the electronics, make sure the square nut is correctly positioned in the printed part. **The nut must not fall out!** This can cause fatal damage to the electronics.

- Insert the cover back in, make sure it is properly seated in the holes.

-  **Place the second cover on the top and arrange the cables:**

-  **Extruder bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially in. Also, it must be tilted away from the printer.

-  **Heatbed bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially inside the box.

-  **Filament sensor cable** (optional), ensure that the textile sleeve wrapped around the cables is partially inside the box.

- Now, tighten the second cover. Check that no cable is pinched.

-  **...and it’s done! Enjoy your printer ;)**

# [Importing Multi Material model](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/importing-multi-material-model_121191)

### Importing multiple STL files as a single multi-material model

First of all, **switch the printer preset to a Multi Material printer** (such as the MMU2S), otherwise, the following steps won't work.

1. **Drag and drop all of the STL files at once** into the 3D view
2. Select **File - Import - and select all STL files at once**
3. Select **Add...** Ctrl \+ I from the top toolbar **and select all STL files at once**



PrusaSlicer will ask you if it should represent the loaded models as one single object with multiple parts - confirm the prompt by selecting **Yes**.

### Importing single STL or OBJ file as a single Multi Material model

The STL file format doesn't support multiple objects in a single file natively. However, it's not uncommon for multiple separate models/shell to be in a single STL anyway. PrusaSlicer will load such models as a single object. If you wish to split the objects into multiple parts, use the [**Split to parts**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/split-to-objects-parts_1751) function in the top toolbar.

### Importing 3MF as Multi Material model

3MF files natively support multiple objects in a single file, Multi Material models should be automatically recognized and loaded correctly. Saving a project file (File-Save) is the ideal way of storing and sharing Multi Material models for Prusa printers.

# [Removing filament from extruder manually](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/removing-filament-from-extruder-manually_121491)

In case there is a clog in your hotend, the filament might grind against the Bondtech-gears and be damaged enough so it can't be unloaded. It might snap right above the PTFE-tube when you try to pull it out by hand. In this case, the filament will need to be removed manually.

### Idler door open

Open the idler door by removing the spring-loaded tension-screw(s), on the left side of the extruder.

**MK3S/MK3S+/MK3.5 extruder (single idler screw)** **MK3 extruder (two idler screws)**

#### MMU2S/MMU3 idler door

On the MMU, due to the "chimney" (IR-sensor-holder-mmu2s), you must remove the whole idler door by unscrewing the hinge- screw (red arrow) on the back.

### Where did it break?

**Use Method 1** **Use Method 2**

If the filament snapped right at the edge of the PTFE you should start with Method number 1, where you try to push the filament through the hotend. If there is 0.5-1cm sticking out of the filament, reaching the Bondtech filament-pulley starts with Method number 2, pulling it out with pliers.

### Setup

1. Go to the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> Temperature -> Nozzle_ and set the temperature to 280º C. Wait for 3-5 minutes with the hotend at this temperature.
2. In the LCD menu in _Settings,_ select _Disable steppers_.
3. Go to the _LCD Menu - > Settings -> F. Autoload,_ so A _utoload_ will not interfere.



From now on the hotend will be hot! Avoid touching the lower part of the extruder (heaterblock + nozzle)!

### Method 1: Pushing the filament through the hotend

Using another piece of filament, a thin (1-1,5 mm) Allen-wrench or same diameter wire, at least 4.5 cm long for the MK3(s) and 6 cm long for the MMU2s, you are often able to simply push it through.

1. Feed in from the top of the extruder your tool of choice, down past the Bondtech-gear, and on top of the stuck filament.



If you are able to push the stuck filament down the PTFE-tube with an Allen-wrench, switch to using filament after about 1-2 cm. Some Allen-wrenches may only be long enough to get it started.

2. In case the filament starts being extruded from the bottom, Keep pushing the filament to clear the nozzle and see the color change.



### Method 2: Pull out filament with pliers

While hotend is heated to 280° C, firmly grab the filament with the needle-nose pliers that came with the printer. Slowly drag/feed the filament upwards, bit by bit, through the top of the extruder body, until it is completely removed from the PTFE-tube.

The filament can get stuck on geometry on the path up through where it is fed. It is also possible to pull it out of the idler door.

### Nope, it is still stuck

If none of these methods work, it means that the tip is not touching the part of the hotend that is heated and is stuck in the PTFE-tube. In this case, you must extract the PTFE-tube. Follow the guide linked below to resolve it.

You will probably need to heat the hotend to extract the PTFE-tube with the stuck filament.

# [FAQ - Extended buyers-guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/faq-extended-buyers-guide_123605)

From both individuals and companies in the market for a 3D printer, our [customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) receives a lot of questions regarding our printers and what it takes to get started with 3D printing. We, therefore, made this addition to [our FAQ](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/faq-frequently-asked-questions_1932). We hope this guide can both provide some answers and assist in asking the right questions when purchasing a 3D printer. A side-by-side comparison of specs and numbers can not really inform such a decision. A 3D printer is a machine that can make almost anything you need, but the type of printer, material, and settings all depends on that need.

#### Resin (MSLA) or plastic (FFF) printer? I hear resin printers have more detail.

Yes, printers like the [Original Prusa SL1S](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-sl1s-speed-3d-printer-cw1s-bundle/) do have more detail, but also have a smaller build-area. Resins are hard and tough, but most are brittle when it comes to impact resistance. FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) printers like the [Original Prusa MK3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3d-printer-9/) or [Original Prusa MINI+](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mini-semi-assembled-3d-printer-4/) have a wider range of materials available and also a larger build-space. You can also do multi-material printing, using our [Original Prusa MMU2S](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mmu2s-upgrade-kit-for-mk2-5s-mk3s-org/) (picture below).

While you will be able to achieve incredible detail with an FFF-machine, (M)SLA printers, as the Original Prusa SL1, are commonly used in dentistry, jewelry, and printing awesome board game miniatures. You will know your needs best, but FFF-printing can be easier to get started with for a beginner.

#### Why an Original Prusa printer?

Our goal is to make 3D printing more accessible and embrace open standards. That means that all of our printers and software [are open-source](https://github.com/prusa3d). We are continually working together with the community, listening to their feedback and ideas. Our aim is to deliver an outstanding 3D printer for an affordable price and make this amazing tool available not only to professionals but also to students and hobbyists. Therefore, we provide [24/7 Support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) for any questions regarding our machines and how to get started. In addition, we are developing this extensive [Knowledge Base](https://help.prusa3d.com/), to share our technical insights into 3D printing.

#### What kind of setup do I need?

This depends on your application and the number of printers. 1-2 printers can comfortably be in the same room as the operator, in for instance an office/studio setting. When printing PLA and PETG (two of the more common materials) there is minimal odor and noise. With a larger number of printers and/or manufacturing of ABS/ASA parts, it can be recommended to have a separate ventilated room or enclosure to avoid the noise and fumes this can produce. There are also solutions for remote control and monitoring of our 3D printers.

Our machines come both as pre-assembled or as a kit for self-assembly. The Kit comes with a [detailed illustrated assembly-manual](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/assembly-manuals_2273) and is a great learning experience. The Original Prusa MK3S+ can take about 8-10 hours to fully assemble. The assembled printer just needs to be taken out of its box and after a quick setup, is ready to print.

#### What materials can I work with and what should I use?

Currently, our FFF 3D printers will work with almost any printing-polymer that has a printing temperature below 300 ºC, which includes 98% of the materials out there. The most accessible are [PLA](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pla_2062), [PETG](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/petg_2059), and [ABS/ASA](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/asa_1809), but there are [filaments infused with wood, copper-dust, steel, and much more.](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/composite-materials-with-metal-or-wood-particles_166863) Your choice of material depends on the application of the parts you will be printing. PLA and PETG cover most needs. Our support can help you with this if desired. For a beginner, a good rule of thumb is; PLA for pretty things and PETG for functional things. We have developed an extensive [Material guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials) to assist in finding the correct material and how to print it.

Our machines do not print metal, but the parts printed on our FFF printers can be made into metal through various methods. Moreover, there are robust polymers out there, like [Prusament PC Blend](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusament-pc-blend_134211), that could be a substitute, but if it is mainly metal components you need for your application, perhaps a FFF 3D printer is not what you need.

We also manufacture our own filament, [Prusament.](https://prusament.com/) With its premium-grade materials and thorough testing, we a reaching a manufacturing precision of +-0.02mm, on 1.75mm filament. This makes it probably one of the best filaments in the world these days.

#### What is the process from design to a finished print?

This depends very much on the part, but simple objects like fittings, jigs, and cases for electronics can be quick for an experienced designer to make. Printing time will also depend on the size and material of the part. In most cases, a print will be ready for use within 2-24 hours of printing. There are also [multiple depositories of free 3d models you can search,](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/where-can-you-get-3d-models_2179) download, and alter to your specific need.

#### How can you guarantee a good print quality?

Rigorous testing and a large community dedicated to high print quality; We have one of the largest FFF print farms in the world with [around 500 printers running 24/7](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/a-quick-look-to-our-printing-farm/). We actually also hold the [Guinness world record](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/guinness-world-records-1096-original-prusa-3d-printers-running-at-the-same-time/), for the Most 3D printers operating simultaneously, with **1096 3D printers operating at the same time in one room.**

This experience and our beloved community spread across [forums](https://forum.prusaprinters.org/) and social media, in multiple languages, keeps us on our toes, and assure we know how our designs work on a large scale. Our printers are also by large manufactured using our own printers, so we too rely on their reliable operation. With all of the plastic parts on the printer being 3D printed, we are able to iterate quickly and [provide upgrade-options our users can print themselves.](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/printable-parts-for-original-prusa_1824)

We also develop and update presets and printing profiles for our open-source software, PrusaSlicer. More on that later on.

#### Can you send me samples?

We do have available a [Resin sample set available in our shop](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/sl1s-resin-sample-prints/), printed on the Original Prusa SL1. With it comes a discount voucher of its price, which can be applied to an order for Original Prusa SL1. **For our FFF-printers** , our HQ Maker space [PrusaLab](https://prusalab.cz/en/) will be able to help, but you will have to pay for shipping.

#### What kind of training/expertise is required?

There is a lot to learn, but the learning curve is gentle, and anyone can be printing with little effort. We strive to make it as smooth as possible. Our printers come with a [detailed instructional handbook](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/printer-handbooks_125045) and we provide extensive documentation through the platform you are now reading, [our blog](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/) and our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLHAxAdvAKJY0niRJZRYMvg), informing on every aspect of our machines and 3D printing in general. Our [customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) team can also help you with any technical questions or issues.

#### Does the printer come with any software and can I test it?

Our slicer software PrusaSlicer is [free and open-source](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) and can be [downloaded here](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/). It is a powerful tool to convert your 3D models into a format the 3D printer can read (G-code). Getting started is as easy as importing your model and exporting the G-code, using our presets. If you need something more specific for your application, PrusaSlicer has [a lot of advanced features](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/faq-prusaslicer_1789) like custom supports, hollowing of models, modifier-meshes, and more. You can even do some basic 3D modeling. It is also [fully documented](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/general-info_1910).

Plater-view of PrusaSlicer

However, we do not develop dedicated modeling/CAD software, but we [do have some information on it.](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/creating-your-own-3d-models_2209) We are avid users ourselves, after all, but the choice of software is so much down to personal preference and experience level. There is a great amount of 3D programs out there, from free to very expensive. Your choice depends on your needs, but if you are just starting out you should look to something with a large user base or community. Then you will probably find a tutorial for most operations and tasks, or be able to ask the community for help and advice.

# [How to replace a Buddy control board (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-buddy-control-board-mini_123848)

-

Before covering the electronics, make sure the square nut is correctly positioned in the printed part. **The nut must not fall out!** This can cause fatal damage to the electronics.

-

Insert the cover back in, make sure it is properly seated in the holes.

-

**Place the second cover on the top and arrange the cables:**

-

**Extruder bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially in. Also, it must be tilted away from the printer.

-

**Heatbed bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially inside the box.

-

**Filament sensor cable** (optional), ensure that the textile sleeve wrapped around the cables is partially inside the box.

-

Now, tighten the second cover. Check that no cable is pinched.

# [Sequential printing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sequential-printing_124589)

This option is not available when PrusaSlicer is in

[Simple mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

.

When printing multiple objects at once, you can choose to finish them sequentially, one at a time. This can minimize oozing and strings running between the prints. It can also prevent losing multiple half-finished prints if one of the objects detaches from the print bed.

You can turn this feature on by enabling **Print settings - Output options - Complete individual objects**.

Press the E key to see the **order of objects** in the 3D view.

You can change the order by **dragging and dropping** objects in the [Object list](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/object-list_1758). The top-most object in the Object list will be printed first, and the bottom-most last.

You'll have to check on the printer regularly, with every object there is a chance that the specific part won't stick to the print bed.

### Collisions

With sequential printing, there is a possibility of **collisions** between the print head and one of the finished prints or between the X-axis and one of the finished prints. PrusaSlicer will try to warn of such cases, but even if you get no warning, you should try to avoid possible collisions as much as possible.

**Print objects from front to back, from left to right, and from lowest to tallest part
**

to minimize the chance of collision with the extruder and the X-axis.

**
**

If PrusaSlicer detects a collision, it will visualize it with a red highlight of the overlapping regions.

To help PrusaSlicer detect collisions, specify the **Extruder clearance** settings.

The radius of the cylindrical clearance around the extruder.

The vertical distance between the tip of the nozzle and the X-axis rods (or the lowest part which may interfere with a finished print).

PrusaSlicer wants **all objects to be below the extruder clearance height except for the last object** , which can be as tall as the printer's max Z.

_Visual representation of the default parameter, creating a keep-out zone of 45mm radius and 20mm height around the nozzle (thanks to David Renaud)_

The collision detection logic is pretty basic and will sometimes prevent you from Exporting printable G-code. It's up to you to take responsibility and increase the height tolerance.

#### Example

Height clearance is 20mm.
The object is 25mm tall.

Objects can be printed sequentially, but the current collision logic does not distinguish between the left scenario (not printable, collision with the X-axis rod), and the right scenario (printable). So you have to change the value manually (height clearance).

---

# [Preferences](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/preferences_124601)

You can open the Preferences window by selecting **Configuration - Preferences** or by pressing Ctrl \+ P.

The preferences are split into multiple tabs for easier discoverability.

## General

#### Remember output directory

On by default. When enabled, PrusaSlicer will prompt the last output directory instead of the one containing the input files.

#### Auto-center parts

Off by default. When enabled, PrusaSlicer will auto-center objects around the print bed center. Relative object to object positions is unchanged. Note that when only one object is present on the platter and Auto-center parts is on, it’s impossible to move the object on the print bed as it will always snap back to its center.

#### Background processing

By default, G-code generation starts when the user clicks on the Slice now button or immediately after switching to the Preview. When background processing is enabled, G-code is generated as soon as the models are loaded. As a result, the G-code preview, as well as print time estimate, can be in most cases displayed **instantly** after switching to the Preview.

Background processing is especially useful if you're going back and forth between settings and the G-code preview (e.g. when adjusting support settings).

Whenever a change is detected on the platter (e.g. moving a model, creating a copy of a model) the relevant part of the G-code starts updating on the background. Please note that unlike some older versions of Slic3r PE, background processing is now smarter and doesn’t regenerate the entire G-code, which would be computationally expensive. Only those slicing steps that were invalidated by the user action are recalculated.

Keep in mind that on older, less powerful devices, enabling background processing may result in a less smooth experience overall.

#### Export sources full pathnames to 3MF and AMF

By default, 3MF project files are configured to not save the full path to the source models, as this can pose a (small) security risk when sharing such a file. Enabling it will make the [Reload from disk](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/reload-from-disk_120427) work even in re-opened 3MF files without prompting the user to locate the model in the file system. Learn more in the [Reload from disk](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/reload-from-disk_120427) article.

#### Associate .3MF files to PrusaSlicer

When enabled, this will add the option for opening 3MF files by default with PrusaSlicer to your operating system. You will most likely get prompted by the operating system the next time you try to open a 3MF file.

#### Associate .STL files to PrusaSlicer

When enabled, this will add the option for opening STL files by default with PrusaSlicer to your operating system. You will most likely get prompted by the operating system the next time you try to open a STL file.

#### Update built-in presets automatically

When enabled, PrusaSlicer downloads updates of built-in system presets (print, filament and printer profiles) in the background. These updates are downloaded into a separate temporary location. When a new preset update becomes available it is offered at application startup.

PrusaSlicer

**NEVER**

deletes user-made profiles. Additionally, a complete snapshot of all presets is made during each preset update.

**Windows** C: -> Users -> username -> AppData -> Roaming -> PrusaSlicer -> snapshots
**Mac** “HDD” ▸ ⁨Users⁩ ▸ ⁨username⁩ ▸ ⁨Library⁩ ▸ ⁨Application Support⁩ ▸ ⁨PrusaSlicer⁩ ▸ snapshots
**Linux** ~/.PrusaSlicer/snapshots
[Developer builds](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases) (alphas and betas) use different sets of settings than stable releases. This lets you use developer builds without affecting the stable version in any way. You'll find these snapshots in a corresponding application data folder:PrusaSlicer, PrusaSlicer-alpha,
PrusaSlicer-beta

#### Suppress “-default-” presets

On by default. If any valid Print / Filament / Printer profile is available, the “default” empty profile is hidden from the drop-down menu.

#### Show incompatible print and filament presets

When checked the print and filament profiles are shown even if they're marked as incompatible with the currently selected printer.

#### Show drop project dialog

When you drag&drop a 3MF project file to PrusaSlicer, if enabled, you'll be asked if you want to load just the model or if you want to load and select the printer/material/print profiles as well.

#### Allow just a single PrusaSlicer instance

When enabled, only one instance of PrusaSlicer can run at a time. That means opening files associated with PrusaSlicer will simply add the model to the currently running PrusaSlicer instance. When disabled, you can run multiple instances of PS at once, completely independently. Running many instances at once may slow your pc down if it's not very powerful (cheaper laptops).

#### Ask for unsaved changes when closing the application or when loading a new project

If enabled, when closing PrusaSlicer, you'll always be asked what action to take with unsaved changes and profiles. You can select "Remember my choice" the next time this happens to automatically repeat the selected action in the future.

#### Ask for unsaved changes when selecting a new preset

If enabled, when switching a selected preset, you'll always be asked what action to take with unsaved changes. One of the options is to "Transfer" settings which can be especially useful if you want to keep some of the currently selected settings (e.g. keep supports turned on). You can select "Remember my choice" the next time this happens to automatically repeat the selected action in the future.

#### Ask for unsaved changes when creating a new preset

If enabled, when creating a new preset, you'll always be asked what action to take with unsaved changes.

#### Show splash-screen

Disabling the splash-screen will not make PrusaSlicer start any faster.

#### Clear Undo / Redo stack on new project

If enabled, loading new project will erase the undo/redo history.

#### Enable supports for legacy 3DConnexion devices

If enabled, the legacy 3DConnexion settings dialog is available by pressing Ctrl \+ M.

### Camera

#### Perspective camera (default) - Use perspective camera ON

The perspective camera gives you more information about depth, objects which are far away are smaller than those nearby. A perspective view is as seen by human eyes in the real world.

#### Orthographic camera - Use perspective camera OFF

The orthographic camera is commonly used in engineering. All objects appear at the same scale, parallel lines remain parallel and a unit of length will appear to have the same length everywhere on the drawing. This makes it easier to judge relative sizes and to align models.

#### Reverse the direction of the scroll wheel

If enabled, scrolling upwards will be zooming out, rather than zooming in and vice versa.

### GUI

#### Sequential slicer applied only to top layer

When enabled, the horizontal slider on the bottom of the Preview will only affect the top visible layer. If disabled, the slider will progress through all currently visible print moves.

**Show sidebar collapse/expand button**

If enabled, the Collapse/expand sidebar button will be visible. However, you can always use the keyboard shortcut Shift+Tab even when the button is not visible. This feature is very useful on devices with a smaller screen or when taking full-size screenshots of the G-code preview.

#### Suppress to open hyperlink in browser

By default (when disabled), the individual setting parameters work as hyperlinks to this documentation. Clicking them will launch your browser and open to corresponding documentation article. If enabled, these hyperlinks won't work and will not launch your browser (some users expressed security concerns).

#### Use color for axes values in Manipulation panel

If enabled, the axes' names and values will be colorized according to the axes colors. If disabled, old UI will be used.

#### Order object volumes by types

If enabled, the order of objects in the object list will always be Model part, Negative volume, Modifier, Support blocker, Support enforcer. If disabled, you can re-order them freely. However, one of the model parts always needs to be in the first place.

#### Set settings tabs as menu items

Experimental option to save vertical space on small screens.

#### Show tip of the day notifications

If enabled, one useful tip will be shown each time you start PrusaSlicer.

#### Notify about new releases

When enabled and a newer [stable version](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/download-prusaslicer_2220) of PrusaSlicer becomes available, a notification is displayed at the next startup (never during program usage). "Release only" will notify you only about stable final releases, the "All" option will notify you about all releases, including alpha, beta and release candidate versions.

This is currently only a notification mechanism, no automatic installation is done.

#### Use custom size for toolbar icons

Both the top and left toolbar automatically re-scales based on the DPI reported by your operating system. You can manually override this scaling and set a different scale by using the slider.

### Layout Options

#### Old regular layout with the tab bar

Settings are located in tabs on top of the window.

#### New layout, access via settings button in the top menu

A new button will appear in the top toolbar to access the settings. This can save you some screen space on devices with a smaller screen.

#### Settings in non-modal window

Settings will open in a new non-modal window. This means you can have settings open on one screen and the G-code Preview on the other. Both windows can be interacted with at the same time. This works great if you also enable Background processing - you can change any settings and watch the preview instantly update.

### Dark mode (experimental)

#### Enable dark mode

#### Uses system menu for application

On Widows, the application will use standard system menu. If it looks ugly due to scaling, you can disable it to use older UI.

# [Custom SVG and PNG bed textures](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/custom-svg-and-png-bed-textures_124612)

PrusaSlicer supports custom print bed textures and models in both **PNG** and **SVG** formats.

You can assign a custom model or texture by selecting **Printer settings - General - Bed shape - Set**.

If the texture size doesn't match the bed size, the texture will be stretched to perfectly fit the bed. It is not currently possible for the texture to have elements outside of the print area.

The full path to the selected files is stored into "bed_custom_texture" and "bed_custom_model" Print profile variables.

### Exporting SVG textures from Adobe Illustrator

The [Nano SVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg) parser, which PrusaSlicer uses, does not support every feature of the SVG format. We suggest the following workflow to correctly export SVG texture from Adobe Illustrator:

1. **File - Export - Export As**
2. Tick **Use Artboards** to make sure that the resulting size is correct
3. In the **SVG Options** dialog pick:
* Styling - **Inline style (Internal CSS is NOT supported)**
4. Confirm with **OK**



### Performance

In order to prevent graphics issues due to the excessively detailed print bed textures not fitting into the GPU memory, we implemented the following strategies to cope with the low GPU memory issues:

* We only rasterize the print bed texture to a high resolution of 8192x8192 pixels if the graphics card supports OpenGL 3.0 and newer, or if there is a Retina display connected to a Mac. Otherwise, a lower resolution 4096x4096 print bed texture is rasterized.
* If the detected RAM size is less than 6GB the texture size is reduced by another 1/2 factor
* The print bed texture is compressed with the [Real-Time DXT1/DXT5 C compression library](https://github.com/Cyan4973/RygsDXTc).



In addition to that, after the application start-up, a low-resolution print bed texture is loaded to the GPU first, while the higher resolutions are compressed and sent to the CPU progressively as they are ready.

# [Patterns - set extruder sequence](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/patterns-set-extruder-sequence_124725)

PrusaSlicer lets you define a repeating pattern of color changes. You can access this feature by **clicking the gear icon** in the bottom right corner of the **preview screen**.

The color change interval can be defined either in layers or in millimeters - which can be useful when you’re using the **Variable layer height** function.

To **remove** all of the color changes use the **reset button** located in the bottom right corner of the preview screen.

You can repeat the same color (extruder) in the sequence several times.

# [The Benchy hull line](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/the-benchy-hull-line_124745)

The [3DBenchy](http://www.3dbenchy.com/) is a 3D model designed by CreativeTools specifically for testing and benchmarking 3D printers. And everyone wants to know, how to print a perfect Benchy. Ever since it’s release, one specific problem seems to be present, in varying degrees of severity, in all of its prints - **the infamous Benchy hull line**.


It’s visible on prints from all FFF **printers** on the market, cheap or expensive. It’s visible no matter the **slicing software**. It’s visible when printing from any **material**. It’s visible even in the Benchy [release video](https://youtu.be/_epwuDI9FBI) from 2015. Again, in **varying degrees of severity** \- with some combinations of printer, slicer, and material, it can be almost invisible. Other times, it’s clearly defined, leaving the user disappointed and confused. But once you see it, you’ll be able to find it on essentially all of its prints.

The good news is that **we managed to mostly eliminate the Benchy hull line in our sample G-codes** (not in 100% cases though, more on that later). You can [download the G-code here](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/3161-3d-benchy/files).

The bad news is that **the fix isn’t universal**.And we’re not even sure if such universal fix is physically possible to exist.

New Benchy sample G-code printed on the MK3S

### A hardware problem?

When you search for the problem online, you’ll often get an (incorrect) suggestion, that it might be a hardware problem. To give you an example, here are some of the suggestions we found online:

* [loose belts](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mk3-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5-mk4_112380)
* bent Z-axis rods
* irregularity in your z-axis lead screw at that height



If the problem is one thicker line or two thin lines at height of the Benchy’s deck, it’s most likely **not a hardware problem** with your printer. On the other hand, if you get uneven layers from top to bottom, it is most likely a hardware problem (which we’ll not discuss here).

### The culprit

We believe that the main culprit is the sudden **transition from sparse infill into full top layers** around the 8 mm height (may vary a bit depending on your layer height and number of top layers).

At this point, there is an abrupt difference in the time a layer takes to print.

And a few layers later, another sudden change happens. When the deck is finished it’s no longer an almost solid layer, but just a few perimeters again.

Here are the factors that influence the severity of the Benchy hull line

* Filament material thermal expansion coefficient
* Print cooling
* Print environment
* Other filament properties - dryness, composition



A seemingly similar, yet partly different problem is when printing boxes. They also tend to have a line at the height where the bottom solid layers transition into walls. This has more to do with thin walls, extrusion width, and the material has nowhere to go, but outside. Our slicer team knows about this problem and it's something that will likely improve in the future.

### Why can’t the slicer automatically detect and correct for this?

It’s physics. Plastics, if extruded first from pellets into a filament, and then from filament into a very thin rectangular extrusion, will behave neither as a liquid nor as a solid. The stretching of the plastic will align the long molecular chains of the polymer, introducing internal stresses to the extrusion. This internal stress will pull the extrusion together if not cooled quickly enough. For example, on the MK2 the 3D Benchy has the line more pronounced on the side away from the cooling fan.

It depends on the **environment** too. Indeed, as many of you found out, in a cool basement the effects are more pronounced. The same G-code printed on the same printer with the same filament can have a Benchy hull line in one room and not in the other. It’s very difficult to automatically compensate for that.

And to compensate for the internal stresses and cooling effects of the filament. One of the reasons being the viscoelastic behavior of the molten plastics, and the dependence of the plastic behavior on its composition, temperature, hydrolysis of the polymer molecular chains. If the filament is not 100% dry (polyesters - PLA & PET are sensitive to hydrolysis, hydrolyzed filament contains shorter polymer chains, thus being less viscous), the effectivity of the cooling, reflections of the cooling air from the already printed objects, etc.

### How did we modify the G-code to eliminate it?

Something that helps, is to make a modifier mesh in the shape of the deck. When aligned at the problematic spot, it can be used to split the hull and the deck. They are then printed separately, plus the infill doesn’t fill the entire area all the way to the hull perimeters.

Then there’s the order of elements inside a layer. For some reason, we got better results when always printing the deck perimeters first, then infill of the deck and then the rest of the layer. We manually edited this order using a text editor.

We’re not sure if it ended up helping, but we also manually edited the G-code in order to slightly lower the flow of solid infill, except for the very top layer (of the deck).

Another thing is to print the perimeters as continuously as possible. Rather than printing perimeters, then infill and then transitioning to the next layer it’s better to print two (or more) layers of perimeters one right after another. The printer then can go back and print the infill, again two layers at a time.

We most likely haven’t discovered all factors and in precisely what ratios they influence the severity of the Benchy hull line. Still, we wanted to share our findings. If you make your own research and tests, let us know of your findings.

# [Firmware updating (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-sl1-sl1s_124776)

The Original Prusa SL1 has an update-server, which is checking for updates automatically. There is no need to do it manually, but this option is still possible.

Starting from firmware 1.5.0, you can also choose to check for beta versions of the firmware. Note that the beta versions are the ones that have not been officially released, and might have bugs still to be fixed before the final release.

### OTA Firmware upgrade/downgrade

If your printer is [connected to the internet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/internet-connection-sl1-sl1s_1981), it can check whether a newer firmware is available online. Go to the _LCD menu - > Settings -> Firmware_. There, you can 'Check for updates' and select if you wish to receive Beta updates or not.

If any updates are available, select the option 'Download now', and the new firmware will be shown to be downloaded and installed.

#### Downgrade

Starting from firmware 1.5.0, you can also easily downgrade the firmware by selecting the option in the menu. The printer will downgrade the firmware and restart. Note that you can only downgrade once from the current firmware. For example, if you have firmware 1.5.0 you can downgrade to 1.4.2, but further downgrades are not possible.

### USB firmware upgrade/downgrade

If the printer is not connected to the internet, you can update or downgrade the firmware using a USB flash drive.

1. [Download the firmware](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/#driver-sl1) and extract the .zip file.
2. Copy the .raucb firmware file to the root directory of a USB flash drive (Not within a folder).
3. Plug the USB flash drive into the front USB port of the printer.
4. Go to the _LCD menu - > Settings -> Firmware_. The system will recognize the file on the drive, and show the option at the bottom of the menu. Tap the file name to update the firmware.

# [Firmware updating (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-mini-mini_124784)

On the MINI you flash the firmware using a USB flash drive.

1. [Download the Zip file for the firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/downloads/) and extract it on your computer.
2. Copy the .bbf file in your chosen language to the root directory of a USB flash drive (Not within a folder). All files have the English language, and if all files are added, the chosen languages will be English and Czech.
3. Insert the USB flash drive and push the reset button **.** The bootloader will automatically compare the installed version with the one on the drive and, if newer, will automatically offer you to flash it.
4. Confirm the update by selecting the "FLASH" button and pressing the knob.



If you have received the error "Firmware in the internal flash corrupted" use the alternative method below.

### Updating from firmware pre-4.3.4

Starting from firmware, **4.4.0** , the MINI+ has a new bootloader. This might cause some trouble when updating the firmware to version **5.1.0** and above. In this case, [download](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads/mini-2/firmware) firmware **4.4.0** or **4.4.1**. The downloaded folder will have two files. Flash the printer firmware with the two files in the USB drive. After that, flash the latest [firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/tag/mini-2) as usual.

### Alternative method - older firmware release

It is not possible to flash to the same, or an older version of the firmware release, using the method above. To flash an older firmware the procedure is as follows:

1. Push the reset button, immediately followed by double-pressing the selector knob.
2. On the new screen, confirm the update by selecting the "FLASH" button and pressing the knob.



If it repeatedly only boots the printer and gives you the home screen try to

[format your USB flash-drive](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sd-cards-and-usb-drives_112291)

or try a different one.

**Even if the flash drive works with G-Codes and printing, it may not work for flashing the firmware.**

# [Assigning tools / colors  / extruders](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/assigning-tools-colors-extruders_124811)

You can assign different print features to be printed with a different tool in the **Print Settings - Multiple Extruders** menu.

You can set a different tool for:

* Perimeters
* Infill
* Solid infill
* Support material
* Support material interface layers
* Wipe tower’s external perimeters



#### Painted models

If you've used the [Painting tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multi-material-painting_262620) to mark parts of the object to be printed with a different tool, you can assign the tools there directly.

#### Models with separate shells

If your model imported correctly ([ **Importing MMU model**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/importing-multi-material-model_121191)) you'll see each part in the object list on the right side. If you don't see the object list, switch to the **Advanced or Expert mode**.

You can assign a color (extruder) to a part by **double-clicking on the colored rectangle** in the Object list. You can also simply press a number key, e.g. "3" to assign the extruder to the selected model.

Alternatively, you can select a part in the object list, **right-click** on it in the 3D view and select **Change extruder - Extruder [number]** from the context menu.

### Changing the preview color

Changing the color of the individual "extruders" has no actual effect on the print, but it's a nice way to visualize it and it can help you select the right filament colors. You can change the color assigned to an extruder by clicking on the **color box** next to the profile name in the Filament profile selection.

# [ColorPrint with the MMU](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/colorprint-with-the-mmu_124861)

PrusaSlicer supports the following scenarios:

1. **Single material printer** (or MMU2 in Single extruder mode).
In this case, color-changes (manual filament swaps) can be added, but not extruder-changes.

2. **Multi-material printer with the same extruder assigned to all objects** , to their volumes and to modifier meshes.
Color-changes (manual filament swaps) for an arbitrary extruder and automatic tool changes of an active extruder to another extruder can be added.

3. **Multi-material printer, where more than one extruder is assigned to objects** , to their volumes or to modifier meshes.
Only color-changes can be added. Extruder-changes are already defined by extruder assignments on the Plater and we do not allow them to be extended or overridden by ColorPrint.
While in theory, it could be possible to combine extruder-changes of Plater with the extruder-changes of the ColorPrint, the result would be difficult to interpret by the user, so we decided to keep it simple.




It is possible to edit any Color Print action after it is created (right-click), the layer slider has to be exactly on the layer you wish to edit.

When color/extruder-changes are added and later made invalid by switching a printer profile or changing extruder assignments at the Plater (going from scenario 2 to 3 above or vice versa), the invalid color/extruder changes are marked with an **exclamation mark** to alert the user.

Any such color/extruder change will be **ignored** during the G-code export. Further manipulation with the ColorPrint slider is blocked before these conflicts are resolved by the user.

### Examples

#### Automatic layer-based color change (ColorPrint - scenario 2)

Imagine this as a normal color change with the single-extruder printer. Each layer can have only one color at the same time. But rather than switching the color manually, you can pick which extruder to use next.

Move the layer preview slider to desired color change height, click on the orange plus icon and select **Change extruder**.

If you enable

**Print settings - Multiple Extruders - No sparse layers**

each color change will add only one layer to the wipe tower.

#### Printing with more than 5 colors at once with the MMU2S (scenario 3)

Let's say that you have a multi-material print with all 5 filaments already in use. However, you wish to use one more color by manually changing the filament in of the of the mmu slots.

Simply move the layer preview slider to desired color change height, click on the orange plus icon and select for which extruder you wish to add the color change. All extruders used in the current layer will be marked.

The resulting model with 8 colors used in total:

The action that's prohibited in this example is creating a layer-based color change by assigning a different extruder to a half of one part. E.g. the roof can be dual-colored (red/pink), but this color change can has to be done only manually. If you wish to make the change automatically by assigning different extruder, split the model into two separate models.

# [Wipe tower](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/wipe-tower_125010)

### Smart wipe tower

The smart wipe tower ensures **sharp color transitions** and **stable filament flow** after a color change while aiming to waste as little filament as possible. There is always only one wipe tower no matter how many objects are being printed at once.

**The size of the wipe tower is independent of the size of the object being printed.**

Printing multiple copies at once or printing big objects improves the overall efficiency of the filament used.

#### Wipe tower placement

As soon as you select a multi-material printer in the Printer selection box, the smart wipe tower will appear in the 3D view. The preview shows its maximum footprint, because the size may decrease after slicing, based on the number of color changes in each layer. The size will decrease from the edge with the polyline. You can change the placement of the wipe tower by dragging it with the left mouse button. Make sure the wipe tower doesn’t intersect any of the objects.

To shorten the travel moves between the object and the wipe tower, place it in the near proximity of the object/objects.

_The real size of the wipe tower is visible in the G-code preview_

#### Wipe tower size

In **Print settings - Multiple Extruders - Wipe tower** you can set the **Width** of the wipe tower. The other dimension is calculated automatically based on the amount of filament necessary to purge.

The purge amount can be set by clicking on the **Purging volumes...** button in the right panel.

The wipe tower is rarely solid. Instead, the ratio of sparse and dense infill is automatically adjusted every layer, based on the current number of color changes, in order to waste as little filament as possible.

If you see a line in the air above the Wipe tower, that's **normal**. It's the visualization of the final extruder ramming before it unloads the last used filament (in order to create a sharp tip).

### Wipe tower without sparse layers

The wipe tower size can be reduced by skipping the sparse layers (layers without a tool change). This saves material and in almost all cases reduces the print time.

1. Go to **Print settings - Multiple extruders**
2. Tick **No sparse layers (EXPERIMENTAL)**



On our set of multi-material projects, this feature reduced the total print time by 3.16%, and the filament deposited on the wipe tower was reduced by 16.17%.

The wipe tower without sparse layers feature is very useful together with

[ColorPrint with the MMU](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/colorprint-with-the-mmu_124861)

. Only a handful of filament switches are needed to print a colored sign unattended and as a result, a lot of material is saved compared to a full wipe tower.

**Turn off Crash detection**

if you're using a wipe tower without sparse layers. Otherwise, you're risking a potential collision between the x-axis and the printed object during crash recovery.

As PrusaSlicer currently does not check for collisions of the extruder with the printed object when lowering down to the top of the wipe tower, this feature is marked as experimental, and it is recommended to place the **wipe tower to the rear right corner** of the MK3S's print bed, while the **object is placed to the opposite corner**.

### Wipe to infill

Since the inside of the model isn’t visible, it can be used to wipe the nozzle during the color transition. The wipe tower cannot be eliminated completely, because some models do not have enough infill, but wipe to infill can **greatly reduce the amount of wasted material**.

1. **Right-click** on a model in the 3D view.
2. Choose **Wipe options**.
3. Then in the right panel tick **Wipe into this object’s infill**.



Dark filament purged into infill may be visible through light-colored walls. To avoid this issue, we suggest increasing the number of perimeters.

### Wipe object

To further decrease the amount of material used for the smart wipe tower, you can choose to wipe residual filament into an object. The so-called ‘wipe object’ will be used during the color transition to wipe the nozzle. As a result, the colors of the object will be mixed - this is handy in case you don’t care about the surface color (e.g. mechanical parts).

1. **Right-click** on a model in the 3D view
2. Choose **Wipe options**.
3. Then in the right panel tick **Wipe into this object**



**Wipe object taller than the multi-colored object**
The wipe object will be finished with the last filament used during the multi-colored print.

**Multi-colored object taller than the wipe object**
After the wipe object is finished printing, wiping will move to the smart wipe tower.

During a color change, the flow isn't perfectly stable. For example, a tiny amount of air can get trapped in the nozzle as the new melted material pushes from the top. As a result, slight artifacts can appear on your wipe object.

_The footprint of the wipe tower is minimal thanks to the wipe object (gear)_

### Stabilizing cone

The wipe tower can optionally be printed with a “stabilization cone”, which prevents it from toppling over. This feature is especially useful when the wipe/priming tower is very small in footprint, but can reach great heights, as on the Original Prusa XL.

The apex angle of the cone is adjustable in Print Settings-Multiple Extruders-Wipe tower. Setting the value to zero disables the cone.

# [Glossary MINI](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/glossary-mini_125081)

3D printers have their own vocabulary and words for describing their various parts and functions. If you are doing maintenance or about to seek help online, it is necessary to have the right words to describe your issue or problem. We have put together a list of words with explanations, covering most parts on the printer.

Be aware that there are some differences in terminology between the MINI and the MK3/S

1. **Spring steel sheet** \- comes in two variants, smooth and textured. This is where the printed
object appears. Please read the maintenance instructions carefully to ensure optimal conditions
for 3D printing.
2. **Heatbed** \- located directly under the spring steel sheet. Heatbed ensures good adhesion of the
printed object. Warning: do not touch the heatbed when it’s hot!
3. **Y-Axis** \- the general name for the entire heatbed assembly (smooth rods, belt, heatbed…).
4. **Knob** \- main control of the Original Prusa MINI 3D printer: rotate left/right to scroll through options and press the knob to confirm your selection. There’s a reset switch directly next to the
knob. Press it to perform a hard reset.
5. **LCD screen** \- the display is used for the configuration of the 3D printer.
6. **Power switch** \- when the printer is not in use, turn it off using the power switch.
7. **USB port** \- compatible with USB 2.0/3.0 flash drives (FAT32 filesystem). Used for reading
print files (G-Codes) from the inserted drive and flashing the firmware.
8. **Main PTFE tube (Bowden-tube)** \- leads the filament strand from the extruder into the print head/nozzle.
Inspect it from time to time to make sure there is no debris inside that would prevent the
filament strand from reaching the nozzle.
9. **Tube fitting** \- on both ends of the main PTFE tube. In case filament gets stuck in the PTFE
tube, use a spanner (included with the printer) to remove the fittings and the PTFE tube to get
access to the filament strand.
10. **Print fan** \- cools the printed object, and improves print quality. Comes with RPM monitoring.
11. **Print head** \- Lightweight print head consisting of the hotend (printing nozzle), M.I.N.D.A. sensor, and two fans. The heaviest parts of the extruder were moved onto the Z-axis tower to improve
print quality.
12. **Nozzle** \- 0.4mm nozzle, can be replaced with e.g. 0.25mm or 0.6mm E3D-compatible nozzles
to achieve various effects.
13. **Z-Axis** \- the entire vertical axis assembly (smooth rods, Z-axis motor…).
14. **Extruder / Extruder motor** \- as opposed to 3D printers like MK2 or MK3S, the extruder motor
is not moving along the X-axis. Instead, it’s fixed on the side and pushes filament through the
PTFE tube towards the print head.
15. **X-Axis** \- allows the movement of the belt-driven print head from left to right.
16. **Spool holder** \- should be placed near the printer, so the filament strand can enter the PTFE
tube from below. The filament must not bend at an acute angle.



#### Additional terms

**M.I.N.D.A. sensor** \- Induction sensor for auto-leveling.

# [Glossary SL1/CW1](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/glossary-sl1-cw1_125089)

3D printers have their own vocabulary and words for describing their various parts and functions. If you are doing maintenance or about to seek help online, it is necessary to have the right words to describe your issue or problem. We have put together a list of words with explanation, covering most parts on the printer.

#### This glossary covers the SL1 and CW1.

**Knob** \- Large black knob at the top of the cantilever is designed for an easy mounting/dismounting of the print platform.

**Tank** \- The container for liquid resin. It has a transparent bottom that allows UV light to pass through. The bottom of the tank is an FEP film, a consumable that will degrade after some time. The FEP film is replaceable (see [Printer Maintenance](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sl1-sl1s-maintenance_1951#fep-film-tank-maintenance)). Use only warm water and dishwashing soap to clean the FEP.

**Tilt** \- The general name for the whole bed with the motorized tilt function. The tilting tank is one of the biggest advantages of this machine. Thanks to this solution, smaller forces are required to pull the object from the bottom of the tank, which results in better-looking models and more reliable printing.

**Tower / Z-Axis** \- The mechanism that raises and lowers the cantilever with the print platform. The cantilever is secured with a ball screw.

**Acrylic Lid /Lid** \- The orange-colored lid is made of acrylic and its layers protect the liquid resin from UV light (such as sunlight), which would otherwise cure it. Still, it’s not a 100% shield and the printer should not be placed in direct sunlight. It must be closed during printing.

**Liquid resin** \- Liquid materials used for printing in SLA 3D printers. It requires special care during handling (see [Resins](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/resins_1977)).

**Curing / solidifying** \- Curing is the process of solidifying liquid resin using UV light. Even sunlight contains UV light and it can cause the liquid resin to solidify. The recommended curing time per single layer is usually between 5-12 seconds depending on the resin used - there may be exceptions. Layer height, object size, and exposure (curing) time are the three factors that have a major impact on the length of the printing process and quality of the printed object.

**Touchscreen** \- The main control interface of the SL1. The capacitive touchscreen is used to navigate through the menus, start prints, adjust settings, or calibrate the printer.

**Power Button** \- Turns the printer on or off. This button on the front of the printer won’t disconnect the power supply. To cut off power completely, always disconnect the power cord from the back of the printer.

**Print display / 2K display** \- This display is part of the tilt assembly. It shows a mask (shape) of a single layer at a time, allowing UV light to pass through and solidify a single layer. The fixed resolution of the display means that the X/Y resolution of the printed object is also fixed.

**UV LEDs / UV panel** \- The UV LED panel emits UV light through the mask shown on the print display and solidifies (cures) the resin in the tank, creating the desired object layer by layer.

**Ethernet port** \- Can be used to connect the printer to the local network. It is located on the back of the device.

**USB port** \- Used for reading SL1 print files from a USB drive

**SL1 file (.sl1)** \- File containing printing instructions compatible with the SL1. SL1 files are created by slicing a 3D object using PrusaSlicer

# [Purging volumes](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/purging-volumes_125097)

During a filament change, a small amount of melted plastic remains in the nozzle. As the new filament is loaded, it’s melted as well and starts pushing the nozzle content out. During this time, you’ll see a gradual change in the color of the extruded filament.

In order to ensure a sharp color transition, PrusaSlicer provides several ways to deposit this filament:

The amount of material to be purged during a filament change can be set by clicking on the **Purging volumes…** button in the right toolbar.

_The sheep on the right has the white color contaminated by the blue pigment from the previous filament_

### Simple mode

By default, you can simply set how much material will be purged when the filament is being unloaded or loaded. This lets you optimize the amount of wasted filament by, for example, decreasing the amount to purge when loading black filament. On the other hand, you can increase the value when transitioning to very light colors, to ensure they are not contaminated by previous colors.

**unload** **load**
**Black** 8030
**White** 2070

Transition **Black** to **White** = Black unload + White load = **80 + 70 = 150 mm³**

Transition **White** to **Black** = White unload + Black load = **20 + 30 = 50 mm³**

If you switch to the Advanced mode, you can see the resulting purge volume calculated for each color change combination, with the current settings from the Simple mode.

When using a

**soluble filament**

to print supports, increase the purge volume to at least

**120** **mm³ for the unload**.

Filaments with additives (highly glossy, lots of glitter etc.) may also need increased purge volume

### Advanced mode

In the advanced mode, you'll be presented with a matrix. Each cell represents the amount of filament required to purge during filament change from filament X (left column) to filament Y (top row).

# [Prusa Face Shield disinfection](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusa-face-shield-disinfection_125457)

**ATTENTION:**

Don't copy/paste the information below, always link to this article. The information is subject to change.

### About the Prusa Face Shield

The 3D-printable face shield is a reaction to the urgent demand for the protective equipment required by doctors and other professionals due to the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). The shield is developed and consulted with the Czech Ministry of Health. **All tests were performed by leading Czech laboratories and hospitals to ensure conclusive and reliable results.**

More details about the PRUSA PRO Face Shield including the assembly manuals can be found here [prusa3d.com/covid19](https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19)

**WARNING**

: Read the information below carefully, prepare your cleaning desk and protect yourself!

### Before you start cleaning

Before you start cleaning the shield, it is important to protect yourself. Use gloves, a facemask and if possible another face shield. **For safety reasons, consider the shield you are about to clean contaminated at every possible surface and take appropriate measures!**

**In case the shield was contaminated directly by aerosol (e.g. cough)** and you have another face shield(s) at your disposal, consider throwing this one into hazardous waste. If this is your only face shield, wash it thoroughly under running water first and make sure you have properly disinfected the sink, otherwise consider it contaminated and alert your colleagues.

Prepare your workplace, where you will clean the shield(s). **Disinfect the surface of the desk** properly before you start.

**Don't clean multiple shields at once, separate them** into several batches, avoid cross-contamination!

**To ensure the shield is cleaned properly, we recommend disassembling it first:**

* remove the elastic band
* remove the lower part, the "chin" - gently pull the part down from the visor
* remove the upper part, the "headband" - carefully straighten the side(s) first, then remove the visor



_You can use the_ [How to assemble the PRUSA PRO face shield](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-assemble-the-prusa-pro-face-shield_136169) _to learn more._

### How to clean the face shield

**WARNING:**

Before you apply any disinfection solution onto the visor, try it first near the edge! Wait for a while. Inspect whether the solution caused damage to the surface of the visor.

**It is highly recommended to submerge (sink) the shield parts** into disinfection solutions, this way you will ensure that the solution reaches 100 % of the surface. You can also use aerosol (spray) but apply the procedure at least twice to reach most of the surface.

Select one of the disinfecting methods from the table below, let the solution do its job. Most of the solutions will evaporate after several minutes. You can remove the remains using a paper towel, avoid using the same towel on multiple shields, avoid cross-contamination. Always wipe in one direction.

### Recommended methods

The methods listed below, seem to be the most promising to kill the virus and are currently being verified by the professionals. Hospitals and other medical workplaces can use their professional sterilizing equipment to properly sterilize (disinfect) the face shields before using them again. A test on a single shield is recommended to verify possible damage of the sterilization.

**All tests were performed by leading Czech laboratories and hospitals to ensure conclusive and reliable results.** Detailed info about the testing facility and conditions of the test are described between the tables.

The tests were conducted on the Prusa Face Shields printed from [Prusament PETG Orange](https://prusament.com/materials/prusament-petg/). The official design of the Face Shield is available at [PrusaPrinters](https://www.prusaprinters.org). We cannot guarantee the methods will work on a different design (geometry) or material due to different properties (e.g. PLA will melt if exposed to high temperatures).

# [3D Printed Protective Face Shields - FAQs](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/3d-printed-protective-face-shields-faqs_125479)

### Where can I find more info about this project?

We have prepared a special microsite on our page and we are updating it regularly - see <https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19>.

### **Can I wear the face shield instead of a surgical mask or respirator?**

No, the shield alone is not a replacement for a surgical mask or respirator. It should always be combined with a surgical or respirator due to the way the virus spreads. It’s also important to follow health and safety rules even when wearing one. The virus doesn’t spread through the air only, it can also be spread by touch, avoid touching your eyes/eyelids, etc. The visor can improve protection from viruses that spread through the air in the form of spray - e.g. sneezing. The shield can also help extend the use of other protective equipment by offering additional protection from external sources of contamination.

### **Are the shields single-use only? Can I disinfect/sterilize them?**

Currently, we label the shields as single-use due to the fact that the tests are not finished yet on how to properly sterilize them. We have [published an article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusa-face-shield-disinfection_125457) covering various options for disinfecting the shields, however, the tests are still in progress. Exercise caution when wearing the shields for extended periods of time. We will continue to update the article with new results regularly.

### **Are the shields approved by any authorities (e.g. Ministry of Health)?**

We have consulted with the Czech Ministry of Health on our design for the shields and they allowed us to distribute them. The shield is suitable to be used by doctors and it is compatible with other parts of their standard equipment (like glasses and surgical masks) however, the shield is not an officially certified piece of medical equipment. Before you start producing them in your country, we suggest consulting it with local authorities first - the situation may be different in your country.

### **I would like to help produce these shields. How can I join?**

You can check with your local 3D printing communities or visit <https://www.prusaprinters.org/> and search for groups producing these masks.

### **Can I adjust the shield design?**

Absolutely! The design is fully open-source. However, we recommend making only changes that were consulted with those who use these shields. The changes should be based on real-life experience, let’s say you try to make them more comfortable to wear, but they might start to fall off more easily during quick movements. Try to stick to changes that are practical and won’t have a negative effect on the basic functionality, in other words: something that looks good on paper might cause trouble in real life.

### **What are the changes between RC1, RC2, and RC3?**

Generally speaking, we’re trying to make the 3D-printed parts safer, more comfortable and faster to print. These efforts are reflected in updated designs. See the details below: Version RC3 changelog changes from RC2:

* Removed hexagonal holes for faster printing speeds.
* With faster printing we use on our farm, some pieces had sharp points, and based on testing, the venting is not needed as much.
* Several optimizations for stack printing.
* New print files with 4 headbands stacked on top of each other - especially useful for overnight printing.



Version RC2 Changes from RC1:

* Increased wall thickness (slightly stiffer and more durable).
* Inner wall from 1.5 mm to 2 mm.
* Outer wall from 2 mm to 2.5 mm.
* The headband is no longer printed compressed. Lower pressure on the temple.
* The visor was moved further away from the forehead. This allows a better fit over bigger respirators and protective goggles.
* The printed part now has an extension for the visor (the visor curves less than the headband).



### **How long does it take to make one shield?**

Depends on which version you decide to print. RC3 takes about 3 hours, RC3.1 takes 1 hour and 20 minutes - however, it requires a well-calibrated 3D printer and expect noises louder than usual due to high speeds. You can also fit more units on a single print sheet if it is big enough, so you can let it run overnight. Assembly takes just a few minutes, depending on how you source the visor (e.g. if you have them laser-cut from PETG sheets or you need to cut down PET bottles to make them).

### **I have a 3D printer, but no means to produce a transparent visor. What should I do?**

You can get in touch with the rest of the community on social media or via PrusaPrinters.org and find someone in your area who has access to materials needed to make the visors.

### **Can I sell the shields?**

Well, we won’t stop you, but it goes against the general idea of providing important protection equipment for free to those who need it the most: people in service who face the threat of COVID-19 on a daily basis while trying to help as many people as possible. Donating the shields for free also means a much faster (and direct) delivery - they won’t have to go through a purchase approval process normally required by the hospital management, which would waste precious time. If you need to recoup the costs of production, we recommend you consider a donation system.

### **Can I print them from PLA / other materials?**

PETG is preferable due to its mechanical properties, it doesn’t break/shatter as easily as PLA and it has better temperature resistance. Since we need the headband to be slightly elastic, we would suggest sticking to PETG. Many sterilization procedures also consist of heating the shield to over 60°C (140+ degrees Fahrenheit) - PLA isn’t suitable for such temperatures. ASA and ABS are better alternatives than PLA if PETG isn't available.

### **Where can I get the transparent visor and the rubber band?**

The shield design was made with simplicity in mind, so there are many ways to source the materials. The best way is to get laser-cut PETG sheets. Check your local hardware stores (online or by phone preferably) and see if they have a reasonable number in stock and deliver them to you. Another good option is a thick laminating foil that will hold shape and will put some resistance before it bends. The third option is to cut a large PET soda bottle. The rubber band is just a generic rubber band, available pretty much everywhere. The specs for the PETG sheets we’re using: clear PETG plastic sheet (Covestro Vivak brand) with a thickness of 0,5 - 0,8mm (common thickness in the US is 0.02"-0.04"). You can use any clear laser-cuttable plastic with a similar thickness. The size of the visor is 240×240 mm / 9.45’’×9.45’’ (standard version) and 240×310 mm / 9.45’’×12.2’’ (extended version). The holes can be made with a standard office puncher. For the exact dimensions of the sheet and holes, download the PDF files from the description of the shield at PrusaPrinters.org. You can [follow the assembly guide here](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-assemble-the-prusa-face-shield-rc2-rc3_125495). The guide for an alternative version (using thick laminating foil) is [available here](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/assembling-the-prusa-face-shield-rc1-rc2-rc3-community-version_125830). Please note that standard DINA4 / A-4 sized foils are not large enough.

The “chin” is a vital structural part that holds the shape of the shield. We’re manufacturing 3.000 shields a day and it’s not enough, so we are of course looking for ways to speed up the production - however, removing the bottom part of the shield is not an option.

### **Can anyone use the shield? Medics, police officers, etc.**

We suggest consulting first with those who might need a shield to see if it fits their requirements. In the Czech Republic, the shield is universally used by anyone in service or even by staff in stores and pharmacies, simply anywhere where people come into contact. There’s a good chance the situation will be the same in other countries. Always ask first, though.

### **I would rather print a respirator than a shield. Can I help this way?**

Respirators are a different kind of thing. Generally, we’re very cautious when it comes to 3D-printed respirators. The problem is that the surface of 3D-printed objects is highly porous, there are gaps between layers and those areas are perfect hiding spots for germs. A vast majority of available filaments aren’t even food-safe. Plus, Covid-19 can apparently survive between 48-90 hours on plastics. Even though there are news stories about 3D-printed respirators online, they are not printed on home-grade FFF/FDM 3D printers. What you can produce on a common 3D printer is closer to a single-use mask. Some say that “something is better than nothing”, however, we recommend exercising with extreme caution. There’s nothing worse than a false feeling of safety and turning something meant to help into a source of potential infection. If you really want to make masks consider sewing a mask from fabric and use a 3D printer to print the shield.

### **Why should I follow any hygiene measures during production when the shields will be sterilized in the hospital anyway?**

In situations like these, you can never be “too careful”. By exercising appropriate caution, you can help reduce potential risks, there might be people who will accidentally touch the shield before it gets to hospital or is sanitized.

### **What’s the point of making these shields? And aren’t respirators more important?**

There’s a massive shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide. 3D printing communities across the world have the opportunity to put their machines to good use and provide medical workers, police officers, firemen, and many other people with a vital piece of equipment. Not everyone can work from home, there are thousands of people who have to be “out there”, risking their lives. Before the equipment gets to them from official places, all of us can step in and offer help. Respirators and masks are just a part of the proper protection. Your entire face should be protected, not just nose and mouth. The shield can also help extend the use of other protective equipment by offering additional protection from external sources of contamination. We’re very cautious about 3D-printing respirators due to the limits of 3D printing. However, the shield has been verified with the Czech Ministry of Health and even though it’s not medically certified, it does offer real protection. See “I would rather print a respirator than a shield. Can I help this way?” why we don’t recommend printing respirators with a standard FDM/FFF 3D printer.

### **How long does it take to get a shield if I order one now?**

This is difficult to say. Over the past few days, we received orders for more than 100.000 shields in the Czech Republic alone and our production process allows us to manufacture and deliver around 3.000 units a day. However, we are running hundreds of 3D printers. Unfortunately, we don’t have the resources to ship to other countries. Talk to your local maker/3D printing communities, explain your situation and see how fast they react. It’s always better to find someone close by rather than having the shields shipped from the other side of the country. If you’re USA-based, you can use the #GetUsPPE hashtag on social media or visit <https://getusppe.org/makers>.

### **I know that within the Czech Republic you’re providing the shields to everyone in need free of charge. However, I would still like to make a donation.**

We truly appreciate your generosity! At this moment, we’re evaluating possible options for donations that we would like to pass on to a trustworthy charity. Once a decision is made, we’ll inform the public through the usual channels.

# [How to assemble the Prusa Face Shield - RC2/RC3](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-assemble-the-prusa-face-shield-rc2-rc3_125495)

- Place the plexiglass in front of you, turn the side with four holes up. Place the headband near the top edge, see the four pins (protrusions). We will use them to assemble the plexiglass, starting in the middle.

**The headband must be properly oriented**

. The pins must be on the bottom while the plexiglass is assembled. For better orientation, use the "PRUSA" sign on the sides.

For easier assembly, it is recommended to push your hand through the headband.

- Mount the plexiglass on the headband using the second hole from the right. Hold it with your thumb.

- Carefully straighten the right side of the headband along the plexiglass and insert the pin. As soon as the pin is through, you can release the thumb.

- Continue on the other side of the headband, apply the same approach. Straighten the headband, avoid bending the plexiglass.

- Take the longer side of the laminating film and fold it gently in half. Avoid "breaking" the film.

- Mark the center on the folded film using the marker.

-

Place film with the marked point on the center of the headband.

- Mark the two pins (protrusions) closest to the center. The side pins will be addressed later. _From our experience it is better to have a slightly bigger distance between the marked points, than the actual distance on the headband. If the distance is too short, the film won't fit._

- Align the hole punch to the marked point on the left side of the film. Note that the second marked point is outside.

- Push the hole punch. It creates two holes on one side.

- Use the same procedure on the right side. You should have 4 holes in total.

# [Cold pull (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mini_126399)

A cold pull is a technique used to clear the printer’s hotend and nozzle of possible obstructions such as filament and other debris. It is also recommended to be part of the regular printer maintenance routine. **A cold pull can usually only be used if the filament is able to reach the nozzle.** If there is an obstruction, a cold pull will most likely not be able to resolve this. Please see [Clogged nozzle/hotend (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mini-mini_112011) instead.

**If you are using a Nozzle X**

, only use cleaning filament. Do not use the cold-pull method as this can damage the nozzle.

We recommend using regular PLA or specific cleaning filaments for this procedure. Using a different color from what you were recently printing with can make it easier to see if the nozzle is clear.

### Procedure

1. Unload any filament that is loaded by going to _Filament - > Unload filament -> [PLA, PETG, ABS etc.] on the LCD-menu_
2. Move the hotend to the right side of the X-axis to reduce strain on the X-axis during the following steps.
3. Unscrew the large brass nut (purple arrow) holding the long PTFE tube by using a 10mm spanner and rotating it anticlockwise. **_The lower portion of the brass fitting should not be unscrewed and removed!_**


4. On the printer display, go to _Settings - > Temperature -> Nozzle_, and set the value to 270 °C (or as indicated for your cleaning filament) to start heating the nozzle.



The nozzle is now very hot! Don't burn yourself.

5. Insert the filament into the hotend from the top that was exposed in step 3. _Make sure that the filament tip is cut to make inserting it easier._
6. From the printer display, select Cooldown from either the Temperature or Preheat menu, _or simply hit the Reset button on the printer._
7. While the hotend is cooling down, continuously push the filament down so that it extrudes from the nozzle. Do so until it cools down to the point where you can’t push anymore through (around 160 - 170 °C).


8. When the temperature is near 90 °C (95-90 °C), hold the X-axis arm to support it, and pull the filament straight up using your hands or pliers, out of the extruder. **Pull it firmly and steadily.**



Be careful! Harshly jerking the filament out can cause it to break inside the hotend or even damage the printer. Make sure to pull straight upwards, not at an angle.

9. Inspect the filament tip once pulled out to confirm that it’s clear of any old filament or burn marks; if it’s still not clean, repeat the process again.



_Three cold pulls in a row, presented from left to right._

10. Repeat steps 4 to 8 at least one more time to ensure that the nozzle is clear and clean of any remaining filament.
11. Resecure the brass fitting from step 3 firmly, using the 10 mm spanner to tighten it. **After removing the extruded filament from the heatbed, the printer is ready for use.**

# [Max volumetric speed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/max-volumetric-speed_127176)

The **Maximum volumetric speed setting (MVS)** is one of the **most powerful features in PrusaSlicer**. The MVS setting essentially creates a manager for the maximum amount of filament that the slicer will attempt to push through your 3D printer’s hotend.

This gives PrusaSlicer users a **huge advantage**. Rather than trying to calculate a range of speeds for combinations of different nozzle sizes, layer heights or extrusion widths, you can simply specify the speeds and settings you desire, then let MVS regulate speeds at slice time when and only if necessary.

Max volumetric speed = Layer Height × Extrusion Width × Speed

Independent MVS values can be set under both **Print settings** and **Filament settings**. In your print profile, you'll typically have an all-around default value based on your hotend hardware. In filament profiles, you can adjust MVS as needed to account for filament characteristics, e.g. decrease it for FLEX filaments (so you won't have to create a new print profile for flexible filaments, just a filament profile).

Set MVS to

**zero**

(0) for

**no limit**

.

MVS is sometimes referred to as auto-speed (auto speed).

#### MVS in Print settings

**Print settings - Speed - Max volumetric speed** (Expert mode)

This value sets the overall maximum volumetric speed. Even if you set MVS to a higher value in filament settings, it will never exceed this value.

#### MVS in Filament settings

**Filament settings - Advanced - Max volumetric speed** (Advanced mode)

This value is capped by MVS set in the Print settings, you can, however, override it to a lower value.

Much of the time, neither linear speeds nor max volumetric speed matter when doing small prints. The nozzle never comes up to full speed and spends most of the time speeding up and slowing back down at lower speeds. It’s when you start doing larger parts or moving fast for things like infill that it matters. “Obeying the speed limit” with the max volumetric speed setting avoids extruder clicks and jams that can spell disaster mid-way through a large print.

### Choosing MVS

#### Filaments

Different filament materials have different characteristics. Viscocity, stiffness and other factors may greatly reduce effective throughput.

**Filament** **Max volumetric speed (approx.)**
PLA15
ASA/ABS11
PETG8
BVOH/PVA (soluble supports)4
FLEX (TPU/TPE)1-2.5

#### Hotends

The overall maximum volumetric speed you should use depends on your hotend. The E3D V6 hotend that ships with the Original Prusa i3 MK3/S is advertised with a rate of 15 mm3/s. A safe value that leaves some space for imperfect setup (idler tension, slightly jammed nozzle) of 11.5 mm3/s is realistic.

If you need to push more filament, a more powerful hotend will be necessary. The Volcano hotend from E3D increases this to roughly 25 mm3/s but does require modding the printer and the firmware. Other hotend designs allow even higher flow rates.

#### Nozzle diameter

Intuitively, it may seem that the nozzle diameter shouldn't affect the maximum amount of plastic that the hotend can heat in a given amount of time. However, **with bigger nozzles, you can slightly increase MVS** due to lower mechanical resistance - basically, it's a bit easier for the filament to get pushed through the nozzle.

And vice-versa, with smaller nozzles, you'll have to decrease MVS a bit.

With larger nozzles, consider increasing the nozzle temperature to allow for even bigger MVS. E.g. you can print PLA 10-20 °C hotter than our standard profile when using a 0.6 mm nozzle.

****Does printing with large diameter nozzle and tall layer height actually save print time?****

This is an often-overlooked consequence of MVS. When you use a large diameter nozzle and very tall layer height, e.g. 0.8 mm nozzle and 0.5 mm layer height, **your print speed is indeed going to be capped by MVS**. That is unless you install a more powerful hotend on your printer. If you notice in the preview, that your speed is limited by MVS, you can try increasing the nozzle temperature and raising MVS a bit. However, it may be time to simply lower the layer height, you'll get more detail without increasing the print time because the printer will be able to print faster.

### Preview MVS

Once you slice your model, you can switch the preview mode to _Volumetric flow rate_ using the select box in the bottom left corner.

On smaller models, you'll notice you're not being capped by MVS at all. Likewise, if you're printing with small layer height, you're most likely not going to be capped by MVS.

On the other hand, when printing bigger models with tall layer heights, you may notice the speed being limited by MVS, especially when printing infill. If the majority of your model is being printed slower due to the MVS limit, consider lowering the layer height, you'll get more detail "for free".

# [Creating profiles for different nozzles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/creating-profiles-for-different-nozzles_127540)

The default nozzle diameter for most of today’s printers is 0.4 mm. If you decide to use a different diameter nozzle (you can read all about the benefits in [our article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/everything-about-nozzles-with-a-different-diameter_8344/)) and there isn't a built-in profile for it, you'll have to make one yourself.

Rather than creating a brand new profile, it's best to start with an existing profile and just modify it.

The two main things that have to be adjusted are:

* Nozzle diameter in Printer settings - Extruder 1
* Extrusion width in Print settings - Advanced



That means you'll have to save not only a new printer profile but also new print profiles.

****Original Prusa printers in PrusaSlicer have built-in profiles for a variety of different nozzle sizes.
**** Go to Configuration - Configuration Wizard - Prusa FFF and tick the boxes for profiles you wish to import, e.g. "0.25 mm nozzle"

### Nozzle diameter in extruder settings

Go to **Printer settings - Extruder 1 - Nozzle diameter** and enter the exact diameter of your new nozzle.

This value is used in PrusaSlicer mostly as a machine limit. For example, you can't print with a layer height bigger than your nozzle diameter. In fact, your layer height should be 70-80% of your nozzle diameter at maximum, otherwise, the layer adhesion will be significantly compromised. PrusaSlicer also notes the nozzle diameter in the exported G-code as a comment. This is very helpful because the printer can warn you if you accidentally try to print a G-code generated for a different nozzle size.

However, on its own, **changing this value won't make PrusaSlicer generate thicker extrusion lines**.

### Extrusion width in print settings

Setting up the extrusion width is the most important thing when creating a profile for a new nozzle.

Go to **Print settings - Advanced**.

You'll see a list of different extrusion width settings.

* Enter extrusion width manually e.g. 0.65 ( **preferred** )
* Enter 0 and PrusaSlicer will derive the extrusion width from the nozzle diameter
* 1.125 × nozzle diameter will be used
* Enter a percentage e.g. 120%
* the percentage is calculated from the **layer height** , not nozzle diameter



#### Extrusion width tips

Generally, you want your extrusion width to be about **110% of your nozzle diameter**.

You can increase the extrusion width of the first layer to make it stick better to the print bed (e.g. 120-140% of nozzle diameter) at the cost of lower resolution in the XY plane.

By setting the extrusion width **lower than the nozzle diameter** you can make supports weaker and easier to remove.

****Printer nozzle diameter check on the MK3/S****

If you set up a profile for custom nozzle size and you're using the Original Prusa i3 MK3/S, you might want to delete the nozzle diameter check G-code.

Go to **Printer settings - Custom G-code - Start G-code** and delete the line that says



M862.1 P[nozzle_diameter] ; nozzle diameter check

Alternatively, you can disable the nozzle diameter check feature on your printer
**LCD Menu - Settings - HW setup - Checks - Nozzle - None**

---

# [Cooling](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cooling_127569)

As soon as the melted plastic leaves the nozzle, it's no longer under the precise control of the extrusion system. There are two problems to consider:

1. Printing must always be done on an **already solidified layer** , otherwise, the previously extruded plastic will be moved around and distorted by the new layer
2. When printing **overhangs** or **bridges** , it's important to freeze and solidify the plastic in place as soon as possible. Otherwise, the filament will sag down.



Most 3D printers come with a dedicated **print fan**. By blasting ambient air at the extruded filament, the cooling can be dramatically improved. However, with some materials, this could make things actually worse and cause warping or layer separation. PrusaSlicer lets you adjust the cooling settings for each filament.

#### Keep fan always on

The print fan will always maintain at least a minimum speed. **This setting is typically on** for most materials with the exception of ABS, PC and some flexibles.

#### Enable auto cooling

When enabled, the cooling fan and print speed will change during the print based on the settings below. A text description below will **update with every change of any cooling setting** and will explain in detail the resulting cooling behavior.

When disabled, the print fan will run at a fixed speed the whole time defined by **Fan speed - Min** with the exception of bridges, which can still be defined by **Bridges fan speed**.

### Fan settings

#### Fan speed

You can set **Min** and **Max** fan speed as a percentage of the fan's max RPM.

The **Max** value will be used when the layer print time is below the **Slow down if layer print time is below** value.

The **Min** value will be used when the layer print time is longer than **Enable fan if layer print time is below** value.

If the layer print time is between these two values, the fan speed will run **proportionally** at a speed between the **Min** and **Max** value.

This may seem a bit confusing, but you can use the live-updating text description above Fan settings, which will hopefully make everything clear. Try changing the values and see how the description changes.

#### Bridges fan speed

Overrides the fan speed with set value when printing **bridges and overhangs**. Typically you'll set this to a higher value compared to normal printing.

#### Disable fan for the first X layers

Cooling the very first layer is usually **not necessary** , as it's being laid on a flat surface. With many filaments, you may even want to skip cooling for a few more first layers (typically between 1-5) to prevent warping and detaching the print from the print bed, which would inevitably lead to a ruined print.

### Cooling thresholds

#### Enable fan if layer print time is below

If the layer print time is estimated below this number of seconds, the print fan will be enabled and its speed will calculated by interpolating between the Min and Max speed.

#### Slow down if layer print time is below

If the layer print time is estimated below this number of seconds, print moves speed will be slowed down to extend the duration to this value. The slowing is done by scaling the print speeds, so some moves will still be faster than others.

#### Min print speed

The minimum speed that PrusaSlicer will scale the speeds down to. Printing at extremely low speeds for extended periods of time could lead to problems such as heat creep.

Keep in mind that by raising this value too high, you may partially invalidate the minimum layer time set by **Slow down if layer print time is below**. Because even when printing at this minimum speed, the layer time might be shorter than the set value.

# [Buddy electronics Wiring (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/buddy-electronics-wiring-mini_128025)

With the release of the Original Prusa MINI, we have again developed a new mainboard, which is a 32-bit platform. It still works on 24V and uses Trinamic drivers for motors, allowing for super silent printing, but also includes ethernet, expansion with Wifi, and its 32-bit system, allowing for more complex calculations and processing of much more than just G-code.

**Did you know, that...?
** The Buddy board is designed and built to sustain considerable heat. It does not need any cooling even if the printer is in an enclosure.

- Use two zip ties and push them through the upper slots on the cable-holder.

- ATTENTION! Before tightening the zip ties add the cables from the hotend. Use the channel in the printed part to arrange them properly.

- Once the hotend cables are included, tighten the zip ties and cut remaining parts.

- Open the textile sleeve and insert the cables from the hotend.

- Compare the look of the cable management with the last picture.

The zip tie arrangement was tested with the injection molded double spool holder (provided in the kit and assembled later on). If you intend to use any other frame mounted type holder, make sure the zip ties won't crash into it, which might result in a print failure.

# [Checking/re-aligning the Bondtech gear (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/checking-re-aligning-the-bondtech-gear-mk3s-mk2-5s_133176)

The Bondtech gears have a lot of pulling force. They might seem secure, but unless properly tightened, **on the flat side of the motor's shaft,** they can come loose and remain stationary around the spinning shaft. This might only be intermittent at first, acting like under extrusion, but the gear will continue to loosen and/or slide out of alignment with the filament path.

### Typical issue (false clog)

This might appear as a clog at first, but you can see the motor axle rotating fully, and there is no clicking sound, which is common during a hotend clog. The filament is not moving at all and when pulled out, it does not look like it has been ground by the gear, hence the name "false or ghost clog".

It can be helpful to draw a line on the radius of the axle, to see if it spins or not.

### Accessing the Bondtech gear

Start by getting out your 1,5 mm and 2.5 mm Allen keys. Using the 2.5 mm Allen key, release the spring-tensioned idler-screw(s) completely and open the idler door. It is 1 on the Original Prusa MK3S & MK3S+ (left picture) and two on the Original Prusa MK3 (right picture). The MMU2S extruder has one screw, but some additional parts.

__
_Original Prusa MK3S & MK3S+ / MK3.5_ _Original Prusa MK3 (Non S/+-upgrade)_

**On the Original Prusa MMU2S / MMU3, you must remove the whole idler door ( blue arrows), by removing**

**the screw acting as its hinge ( red arrow).**

### Rotating the motor's shaft

You will now have access to the Bondtech gears. With the idler door open, we will check if the Bondtech gear is secured on the **flat side of the motor shaft and if the gear is out of alignment with the filament path.** We do not recommend moving the motor shaft by hand. The best is to start rotation from the LCD menu:

* Preheat the nozzle from the _LCD-menu - > Setting -> Temperatures -> Nozzle -> 180 °C._ The firmware will not let you manually move the extruder motor unless heated to at least 175 °C.



**The nozzle is now hot!**

Be careful so you do not burn yourself.

* Navigate the LCD menu to _Settings - > Move axis -> Extruder_, and you can now spin the extruder motor, with the knob on the LCD panel.



Make sure the flat side of the motor shaft is visible ( **red lines** ), aligned with the black set-screw on the pulley ( **purple arrow** ), and that pulley grooves are aligned with the filament ( **green line** ).

The set-screw may be stuck due to rust or Loctite. If you have to use a lot of force you may risk stripping the head of the screw. Consult with our

[technical support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287)

before you use excessive force.

You can use a piece of filament, inserted from the top ( **blue arrow** ), to check alignment. Then use the 1.5 mm Allen wrench or your nail to move the Bondtech gear into position, before securing the set screw.

### Clean Bondtech gear

Open the Extruder idler. You can see how to do it in our assembly manuals, section [Extruder idler parts preparation](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_28536#29848), in the E-axis assembly chapter. Clear any left-over filament, rust, or dust with a brush and inspect both gears.

It is recommended to use a [Prusa Lubricant](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-lubricant-applicator-set-5g/) or a PTFE-based grease. However, be careful not to overuse it, as it tends to accumulate dust particles over time. This procedure should be done roughly every 3-6 months, depending on how often you are using the printer.

Put the lubricant on the Bondtech extruder gear teeth. **Apply it only to the toothed part** as seen in the right photo above. If you apply it to the whole gear, it will be unable to grab filament properly!

You can also inspect the needle bearings that are inside and clean them with a brush. However, these do not need any special care, just make sure that both of them are properly inserted.

# [Regular maintenance (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/regular-maintenance-mini_133222)

### Clean the sheet

If the printed objects have trouble adhering to the steel sheet surface, you need to wipe the sheet clean. Choose the right cleaning product for your sheet (IPA, Windex, etc.), pour a small amount of it onto an unscented paper towel, and wipe the print surface. **The surface does not have to be cleaned before every print.** It is just important not to touch the steel sheet with your hands or dirty tools.

**Never clean the textured powder-coated sheet with acetone!**

Doing so will create microfractures in the PEI texture, which will cause the surface to deteriorate over time.

The sheet should be cleaned while cold to achieve the best results - cleaning it when hot can lead to potential injury, either from the heated bed or nozzle. When cleaning at higher temperatures, the alcohol will also evaporate before it can clean anything. More details can be found in the [First layer issues](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804).

### Bearings maintenance

After ~200 hours of printing, the smooth rods should be cleaned with a paper towel. You can buy a lubricant (any good super lube will do) and apply it onto the smooth rods (XYZ axes). MINI is supplied with a tube of Prusa lubricant and it is also [available in our eshop](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/i3-accessories-mk3s-mk25s-etc/968-prusa-lubricant-005g.html).

**Do not apply lubricant on the trapezoid nut or the threaded lead screw of the Z-axis!**

With the printer turned off, move the X-axis (extruder) and Y-axis (heatbed) by hand back and forth a couple of times. If you feel that one of the axes doesn’t move smoothly anymore, the bearings can be taken out and greased on the inside (they should be removed from the axis because the plastic lip-seal will prevent most of the grease from getting inside).

For our detailed maintenance guide, please see [Maintenance tips](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/maintenance-tips_23200).

### Fans

Both fans should be checked and cleaned every couple hundred hours. Computer cleaner spray (compressed air) will get the dust away and tweezers can be used for little plastic strands. Always hold the blades when cleaning the fan with compressed air.

### Extruder driver gear cleanup

The extruder gears do not need any lubrication. However, over time they can suffer from a build-up of filament shavings in the grooves, and loose gripping force that can cause under-extrusion. Use compressed air to blow the debris out or use a small brass brush to clean the grooves, a regular toothpick will do the job as well. Check and clean from the access window on the top of the extruder assembly. Clean what you can, then rotate the gear and repeat. A very small amount of lubricant on **only** the drive teeth does not hurt but can cause problems if it reaches the filament teeth or starts to collect debris.

For more extensive disassembly, see [How to access and clean the extruder-pulley (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-access-and-clean-the-extruder-pulley-mini-mini_126457)

Opening the idler will enable you to clean both gears and/or remove any filament leftovers caught in the extruder gears. It’s advised to inspect the gears from time to time and remove any debris caught in the extruder.

### PTFE tubes

The MINI has four PTFE tubes, **two external and two internal** , that may need a basic level of attention from time to time. PTFE tubes are used to lead the filament strand from the spool, through the extruder, all the way to the nozzle. Over time, filament debris can accumulate in the PTFE tubes.

These tubes should be clean and uniform. If they are deformed they should be replaced. Use a can of compressed air to clean them. **Using a piece of solid wire can damage them on the inside.**

#### Accessing the PTFE tubes:

1. The first tube where you load filament, which leads to the extruder, can be pulled out by hand. _If you are unable to pull out the first tube by hand, please follow[How to access and clean the extruder-pulley (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-access-and-clean-the-extruder-pulley-mini-mini_126457) to Step 8 to release the screw M3x12 screw securing it._
2. The second, longer, main Bowden tube leads from the extruder to the print head. Use a spanner (size 10) to loosen the nuts securing it to the fittings, found at each end of it.



This is also useful if the filament failed to load/unload and got stuck in this tube.

**Internal tubes**

1. Below each fitting of the main Bowden tube, you will find a PTFE tube. Both should be inspected if you have loading issues. The one located in the extruder is a short tube that assists the filament exiting the extruder.
2. The hotend/print head PTFE-tube needs to be clean and slightly compressed when installed inside the heat break. Please see our comprehensive [illustrated guide on replacing the PTFE-tube in the MINI](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-ptfe-tube-mini-mini_119449).



### Nozzle

#### Inside

If you have a clog or print failure you may need to do a couple of Cold pulls. Also, changing from PLA to PETG, **at PLA temperatures can cause issues.** Cold pulls should clear any partial or full clog and get you printing again. See our guide on [doing a cold pull on the Prusa MINI](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mini_126399). When heated, it can also help to use an acupuncture needle (one is included with the kit), to clean the inside of the nozzle.

#### Outside

If your nozzle is covered with plastic on the outside it can affect its thermal properties. To clean it, heat the nozzle for 5 minutes, **and turn the printer off**. Immediately after that use a small brass brush to clear away any old plastic stuck on the nozzle and heater block. Be extra careful around the fragile hotend heater and thermistor wires.

#### Replacement

Nozzles do wear out over time, even when only printing PLA and PETG. If you attempt to print abrasive filaments, like steel-fill, using the stock brass nozzle, the nozzle will be ruined quickly.

Should you need to change the nozzle, you will find a [complete guide here](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/changing-replacing-the-nozzle-mini_134235), covering the whole procedure, as well as some common mistakes you want to avoid.

### Updating the firmware

Keeping your system fresh and up to date is important. The firmware is continuously being developed and new features and operational improvements are implemented regularly, based on testing and feedback from our users. For a complete guide on flashing the firmware, please see [Firmware updating (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-mini-mini_124784).

# [Full system refresh Original Prusa i3](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/full-system-refresh-original-prusa-i3_133258)

While troubleshooting your printer, you should always try to fix the isolated issue by either replacing the damaged component or flashing a new firmware, which fixes the bug. However, sometimes it is not enough and you might need to **perform a full system refresh** , which will delete all stored values, settings and effectively revert the system back to the factory defaults. This article is an abridged explanation of a [full factory reset](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mk2s-mk2-5s-mk3s_2216), [flashing the firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk3s-mk3s-mk3_2227) then [recalibrate from scratch](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_24976), followed by two additional calibrations.

Doing **the whole procedure** not only assure your system is clean and up to date, but also gives us the best outset for efficient troubleshooting.

### Step 1 - Factory reset

First, the full factory reset. This clears old calibration and voltage data not wiped by a Firmware update. Between firmware versions, there can be leftover calibration data no longer supported, or values that have changed index.

**This procedure will remove all calibration data, settings, and statistics from your machine!**

1. Hit the reset button, the X on your LCD module, immediately followed by pressing and holding the selector knob.
2. After a few seconds, you will hear a beep and get a new screen that says "Factory RESET". Now, release the knob and a menu will appear.
3. Scroll down the menu and select "All data". Let it do its thing and the system is now cleared.



Once back in the system it will prompt you to run the wizard. **Ignore this for now.**

### Step 2 - Flashing FW

If you skipped the previous step, stop now, go back and do the factory reset. You must do

**this whole procedure!**

1. Download the latest firmware for your printer, from the left column, at [prusa3d.com/drivers/](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/)
2. Unzip the file, connect your printer to your computer with the supplied USB cable, and open PrusaSlicer.
3. Navigate to _Configuration - > Flash printer firmware_, on the top-bar in PrusaSlicer.
4. Browse to the HEX file, extracted from the file you downloaded, and click "Open".
5. Select the COM port of your printer or hit Autodetect/Rescan.
6. Hit "Flash!" and let it complete its magic. You will have an indicator in the flasher and on the LCD screen.



### Step 3 - Calibration Wizard

### Step 4 - PID- and Temp. calibration (Original Prusa MK3S/MK2.5S)

Almost there, two more optional, but highly recommended steps to be sure absolutely everything is in order. To make sure everything is tip-top, we will run

[PID tuning](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pid-tuning_2265)

of the hotend, and

[Temperature Calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/temperature-calibration_133266)

of the P.I.N.D.A. sensor.

Since the superPINDA does not have a thermistor, **temperature calibration is not available or necessary for the MK3S+.**

1. Navigate the LCD menu to _Calibration - > PID calibration_, and select. It will ask you what temperature to use. If you print mostly with PLA, leave it as is. If you print mostly PETG or ABS, adjust it to 240, but this will not really matter much. Let it run and finish before moving to the next step.
2. On the same Calibration-menu, you will find _Temperature Calibration_. Initiate and let this run through its steps according to the on-screen instructions. This can take 15-20 min. **This is especially important if you are having any leveling issues.**



After this, run the [First Layer Calibration (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364) again, making sure it is set correctly, with the P.I.N.D.A. sensor calibrated.

Success! Your printers system is now sparkling clean. This will rule out any firmware-issue, should there be something you are troubleshooting.

---

# [Temperature Calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/temperature-calibration_133266)

All induction proximity probes alter the sensing distance with increased temperature. This might affect the quality of the first printed layer. P.I.N.D.A. v2 probe, included in the MK3S/MK3/MK2.5S/MK2.5, has an embedded thermistor inside its body to measure the temperature and fully compensate for the drift. A pre-calibrated data table is stored in the printer and the temperature calibration is active by default.

Since there is no thermistor in the SuperPINDA, temperature calibration is not available or necessary on the MK3S+ or MK2.5/MK2.5S equipped with the SuperPINDA.

However, it can drift out of calibration over time, and you may also find this calibration helpful when weather and temperatures change in the spring and autumn.

The calibration is fully automatic, but we will lead you through it so you know it went OK.

1. Start by taking off the Flexible steel sheet.
2. Navigate the LCD-menu to _Calibration - > Temperature calibration_. Once selected, the printer will home all axes in order to ensure the correct initial position, and warn you it needs an ambient temperature from 21-26 °C (70 - 80 °F) and a stable surface, then ask if the Steel sheet is on the bed. Make sure it is not on and Select "NO".



If you have just heated the printer, the P.I.N.D.A. sensor will need to cool below 35 °C (95 °F). It will move up and show the state of the cooling on the display.

3. The extruder will move in over the bed-surface, stop, and with the pinda positioned over the bed, heat up the bed from 75 - 110 °C (167 - 230 °F), across six parts, while checking the readings given by the stationary PI.N.D.A. sensor.



When completed it will move the extruder back to the home-position and give you the message "Temperature calibration is finished and active", and where to turn it off.

Pro tip: You can check temperature-readings from all thermistors on the Original Prusa MK3S/MK3/MK2.5S/MK2.5 from

_Support - > Temperatures_

, on the LCD-menu.

This calibration can take 15-20 minutes to go through. The temperature-calibration has to run after a completed XYZ-calibration, and it can be recommended to run PID-calibration beforehand, should you receive any errors, like "[Thermal Runaway](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/thermal-runaway-i3-series_2131)", when running the calibration.

# [Prusa Connect Local (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusa-connect-local-mini_133279)

Starting the firmware 4.0.5, you can monitor your Original Prusa MINI over your local network via the web interface called Prusa Connect Local. **Prusa Connect Local is still in development** and is an initial release of **Prusa Connect.**

_Screenshot from an internet browser where the printer's IP address is entered as URL._

It is a platform for full remote control of your printer, much like [Octoprint](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/about-octoprint_1790). However, it can currently only provide a live view of your ongoing print's progression, give an estimated completion-time by connecting to an [NTP Server (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ntp-server-mini_151132) and your machine's temperatures. **Full control of your printer will be added in future releases.**

### How to connect

Connect the printer to your network using a LAN cable. The Ethernet connector (RJ45) is situated in the back of the electronics box (green arrow).

The printer has DHCP turned on by default. Go to _LCD Menu - Settings - LAN Settings_ and check whether the IP address has been assigned correctly. Common IP-ranges are 192.168.0.X or 10.0.0.X. Since it is connected by cable directly to your router, you do not need any password as you would with WiFi.

Depending on your network, **connecting to it can take up to ~30 seconds after you turn on the printer.** An icon will appear in the top-right (Right picture - purple arrow) once it has a connection.

The IP Address within _Lan settings_ may not update automatically. Exit _Lan settings_ and return, or select save or load settings to force the IP fields to update.

**Not connected** **Connected**

**If IP "0.0.0.0" is shown and there is not a network icon in the top-right, an IP address has not been assigned and you are not connected.**

On your PC or smartphone, **open a web browser of your choice** , enter the 'IPv4 Address' into the address field then hit Enter. It will now load the Prusa Connect Local web interface.

If you can't see the interface, confirm that the IP is correct and also try a different browser.

### Save/Load Settings

_Save Settings_ options will create an INI-file on the USB drive containing your IPv4 address, netmask, gateway, and MAC address. It can be edited from your computer using a text editor, should you have the need, for instance, if you are setting up a static IP address for your printer. This file can be loaded to any Original Prusa MINI, using the option _Load Settings._

If any item in the INI file contains an incorrect IP address, the item is ignored. All items are optional.


[lan_ip4]
type=DHCP //or "STATIC" (UPPERCASE!), if a static IP is set up in your router's config.
hostname=PrusaMINI // Optional.
address=0.0.0.0 // From your router's config.
mask=0.0.0.0 // From your router's config.
gateway=0.0.0.0// From your router's config.

### Troubleshooting

As routers and networks have different configurations, it is hard to provide support in this respect. Please check the documentation of your network to whether you need to grant access for the printer or similar. However, if the MAC Address, within 'LAN Settings', is displayed as "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff" (red square picture below), it may indicate an issue with the Buddy mainboard.

# [Skirt and Brim](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/skirt-and-brim_133969)

Some options will only appear when

[Expert mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

is selected.

### Skirt

The skirt is a printed outline of all of the models on the print bed. It's printed before any of the models and its purpose is mainly to **stabilize the flow** of the filament through the nozzle.

The skirt is also useful to **verify the adhesion of the first layer** to the print bed. Since it's printed before the models, you can quickly change the **Live Z adjust** if you see the first layer not sticking properly or being too squished by the nozzle.

#### Loops (minimum)

The number of loops of the skirt. If the **Minimal filament extrusion length** parameter is set, the number of loops may be higher than the one configured here.

**Set to 0 to disable** the skirt completely.

#### Distance from object

Distance between the skirt and object(s).

#### Skirt height

The number of skirt layers to be printed.

One-layer tall skirts can be difficult to remove from the print bed. Prusa profiles typically use a three-layers tall skirt for this reason.

#### Draft shield

If enabled it creates a skirt as tall as the tallest object in the scene. This can be used to protect ABS, ASA, and other materials from warping by creating a micro-climate around the printed part and protecting the print from draft/wind.

#### Minimal filament extrusion length

Forces more skirt loops when necessary to ensure the minimum amount of filament set here is extruded before the skirt is finished. For multi extruder machines, this minimum applies to each extruder.

### Brim

Before you consider applying extra adhesion materials onto the bed, consider using the **B** **rim** **option** in PrusaSlicer which increases the surface area of the first layer. You can set the brim size manually in **PrusaSlicer** by going into **Print settings - Skirt and brim - Brim**.

You should consider using the brim option when **printing:**

* Tall objects with a small base
* Multiple small objects at once



#### Brim type

You can select to print Outer brim only, Inner brim only or both Outer and inner brim.

#### Brim width

The horizontal width of the brim that will be printed around each object on the first layer. Generally, it is advised to use at least a 3 mm brim to increase the adhesion.

#### Brim separation gap

The offset of brim from the printed object for easier brim removal. The offset is applied after the Elephant foot compensation.

### Brim for individual objects

You can turn on brim just for some of the objects and customize brim settings for each object separately. This feature is only available in the **Advanced** and **Expert** modes.

Right-click on a model and select **Add settings - Skirt and brim**. You can then pick which brim settings you wish to adjust for the selected model. These settings will appear in the right panel and override the global brim settings.

# [Connecting Original Prusa SL1/SL1S to PrusaSlicer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/connecting-original-prusa-sl1-sl1s-to-prusaslicer_133977)

Thanks to the advanced operating system available on the Original Prusa SL1/SL1S SPEED printer, the user is able to transfer the sliced .sl1 or .sl1s files directly from the PrusaSlicer. There is no need to copy the sliced file on a USB drive and connect it to the printer.

### Login credentials

The printer has two methods of security to connect with PrusaSlicer, API key and HTTP digest. They can be found in the printer menu in _Main Menu - > Settings -> Network -> Login Credentials_. The default of the printer is HTTP digest, which will generate a user name and Password. It is also possible to disable the HTTP digest in the printer menu and use the API key, which will generate a single code. You will need either the API key or the User name and Password to connect with PrusaSlicer.

**It is recommended to use HTTP digest for the login credentials** , as it is more secure than the API key.

#### HTTP digest

If the HTTP digest option is on you will see a User name and Password which you use to connect to the printer remotely.

#### API key (less secure)

Turn the HTTP digest off to see the API key which you use to connect to the printer remotely.

### IP address or Hostname

In order to identify the printer you are connecting to in PrusaSlicer, it is also necessary to find the IP address or Hostname of your printer.

#### IP address

To find the IP address go to _Main Menu - > Settings -> Network_, and scroll to the bottom of the page. There you will see a QR code and the IP address.

#### Set hostname

You can find the hostname in _Main Menu - > Settings -> Network -> Set hostname_. If you wish to change it, click on the name, and confirm it when done.

### Connecting to PrusaSlicer (Add physical printer)

Open PrusaSlicer and make sure the Original Prusa SL1/SL1S SPEED printer is selected as Printer. Then head to the _"Printer settings"_ tab (green square) and click on the gear on the top menu (purple arrow). An alternative is to right-click the gear next to the printer name, in the Plater view.

_The two ways to 'Add Physical printer'._

To insert the IP address click on the Browse button to show a list of detected devices on your network. Select your printer and click OK to confirm the selection. You can find your printer by the Hostname and by the serial number. In case the printer is not found, insert the IP address manually.

The Login credentials have to be inserted manually at all times. It serves as a verification between the SL1/SL1S SPEED printer and PrusaSlicer, don't share it with anyone. Choose the HTTP digest or API key based on what is on your printer, they must match.

_The window for adding a physical printer._

The last step is to click on the Test button to ensure the connection works properly. PrusaSlicer will notify you with a "Success" message. From now on you will be able to send the files directly via a new button, which will appear in the PrusaSlicer interface.

**IMPORTANT:**

The printer must be turned ON and connected to the same network in order to be recognized.

### Uploading a print

After the model is sliced and you are ready to print, click the G button, located in the bottom-right, next to Export. You will be prompted to give a file name and confirm the upload. Once received, you will be able to start the print from the _Print-menu,_ on your Printer.

Pro tip: Once the file is sliced, use shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G to send the file.

# [M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor testing (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/m-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing-mini-mini_134021)

The Induction auto-leveling sensor is a vital component facilitating the calibration of the MINI and MINI+. It acts like the Z end-stop and is the main component in mesh-bed leveling. You may have either:

* **SuperPINDA** : Stands for Super **P** rusa **IND** uction **A** utoleveling sensor, introduced with the MINI+ upgrade.
* **M.I.N.D.A.** : Stands for **M** ini **IND** uction **A** utoleveling sensor.



### How it works

Starting from firmware 4.3.0, the MINI has the option to see the readings of the M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA on the printer's display. Go to _Info - > Sensor info_, and you will see the M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA status. Note that the menu will always have M.I.N.D.A. written, even if you have the SuperPINDA.

For more details on the MINI/MINI+ Info-screens, please see

[this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/info-screens-mini-mini_206605)

For safety reasons, the M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA will always trigger "1" if disconnected, to prevent it from crashing the nozzle into the bed, should it fail. Therefore it is a telltale sign of a fault **if the Z-axis will move upwards during the mesh bed leveling or homing** , sometimes going up for a couple of points, then lower back down. This happens as the M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA loses connection when the print head is in certain positions due to a small break in the wire.

Overtightened zip-ties can damage cables.

### How to test

Firstly, we need to check if the M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor works at all. For this test, you need a small and thin metal object (spatula, screwdriver, pliers).

1. Raise the Z-axis about 10 cm above the bed to keep it away from any metal.
2. In the printer's menu, go to _Info - > Sensor Info_, and see if the M.I.N.D.A. value is 0, and the red light coming out on top of the M.I.N.D.A. is ON.
3. Place a metal object below the M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA. The status on the menu should turn to 1, and the light on top of the sensor should go OFF.
4. While the metal object is below the M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA, move the X-axis from side to side and wiggle the cable wrap, and see if the light remains OFF constantly and the status at 1. Any flickering would indicate a fault in the M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor.



Within sensor info, it will say M.I.N.D.A., even though you have the SuperPINDA installed.

# [Original Prusa Serial Number](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/original-prusa-serial-number_134171)

Every Original Prusa printer has a unique serial number assigned to it. This is found on a silver sticker on every machine and is also hardcoded to the main controller board. Serial numbers issued before November 2021 start with " _CZPX_ ", while after November 2021 we introduced a new format starting with "SN". All serials are registered in our internal database and they allow us to confirm your printer as genuine.

For some printer models, placing the serial sticker on the frame is part of the

[assembly process](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-electronics-assembly_174100#175963)

!

The best way to reference your printer is the

**order number**

you received when purchasing the printer. This can be found on the invoice or in

[your order-history in the eshop](https://www.prusa3d.com/account/orders/)

.

### Original Prusa MK-series

A label can be found on the back of the frame above the PSU, or on the rear plate of the printer.

_Original Prusa MK-series until 2022_ _Original Prusa MK-series from 2023_

### Original Prusa MINI & MINI+

A label is found on the Z-axis extrusion (circled in red), on the right side.

### Original Prusa XL

The Original Prusa XL may have one or two silver stickers. If the printer has one sticker, the serial number will be on the bottom left. If the printer has both the silver sticker on the bottom and on the top left, the one you should use is the one on the top. In either case, the label will show the text 'Original PRUSA XL'.

_Top printer serial number_ _Bottom printer serial number_

If the bottom sticker shows Original PRUSA PDU, the printer serial number sticker is on the top left of the printer.

### Original Prusa SL1 & SL1S

A label is found on the back (circled in red), in the bottom left.

### Original Prusa Enclosure

The label can be found on the side of the PSU holder.

### Hardcoded serial number

This requires a special application and commands, dependent on the printer, to extract. Nothing proprietary, but the procedure is rather advanced. If you really need to get the serial number this way, please email

# [Watchdog reset MINI](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/watchdog-reset-mini_134201)

The "WATCHDOG reset" error message can appear on the display of the Original Prusa MINI if the system freezes or an operation crashes, for **more than 4 seconds**. This is a global safety feature to prevent the printer from overheating or causing damage to itself or its environment.

It is an internal counter, which, if not reached will reset the processor on the mainboard, and thus the machine itself. This is a general error, which will overrule any previous error. If another error will happen right before the WATCHDOG reset error, the WATCHDOG reset has the highest priority and will be the error displayed.

### Possible causes

#### USB and Filesystem

There have been documented cases where **mounting a faulty USB flash drive, corrupted G-code, or firmware.** Moreover, some USB extenders can cause issues due to their quality, or pin-out. If you are using an extender, please try to plug the USB stick directly into the mainboard and see if the error persists.

#### Temperature

The printer's operational temperature is 16-18 °C (~64 °F). Starting a print below this temperature can cause various errors, like MINTEMP or Thermal runaway. However, this could also cause the Watchdog error which will supersede any error it follows.

### Solutions

If you receive this error, the first thing you should try is to:

* [Format your USB flash drive](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sd-cards-and-usb-drives_112291), and/or try a different flash drive.
* Reslice your G-code, or try one of the [sample G-codes we supply.](https://www.prusaprinters.org/social/16-prusa-research/collections/9934)
* Cycle the power of the printer before attempting another print.
* Look for any unusual temperature fluctuations. It may be another error 'below' as 'WATCHDOG reset' will always have priority, should there be multiple errors in a row.
* Make sure the printer is in a room above the stated operational temperature.



If you are unable to solve this error and it becomes a reoccurring issue, please contact our support.

# [Check Axis Length X/Y/Z (MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/check-axis-length-x-y-z-mk3s_134223)

This error can appear during the Self-test or the XYZ-calibration when the firmware detects a shorter distance of axis travel than expected. The exact length of each axis is stored in the printer's memory. Depending on where it is triggered, it will name the running process (Selftest, XYZ calibration, etc.) and will state the message " ** _Please_ c _heck: Axis length_** " on the display and the letter for the problematic axis, **in the bottom right (" _X/Y/Z_ ")**.

The length of the respective axis is determined on the Original Prusa MK3/MK3S/MK3S+ and MMU2S printers using the Trinamic stepper-drivers, which are detecting the end of each axis by the rise of the current going to the motor. In rare scenarios, the printer movement may not indicate an issue, while the test fails.

### Possible causes for X/Y-axis

Most often it indicates an issue on the hardware level, and as it is the same method used for [Crash detection](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/crash-detection_2100) on the Original Prusa MK3/MK3S/MK3S+ printers, the issue should initially be troubleshot the same way. Check that belts and pulleys are installed as is shown in the [Assembly manual](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/category/assembly-manuals_272), and make sure the axis can move smoothly along the full length of the axis, in both directions. Nothing should be loose. Make sure the pulley set-screw is secured on the **flat side of the motor shaft.** See [Crash detection](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/crash-detection_2100) for more information.

Correct **X-axis** pulley orientation and position.Correct **Y-axis** pulley orientation and position.

Take a look at the extruder from behind, make sure that the cable bundle with the textile sleeve (or spiral wrap) isn't too wide, and touching the frame of the printer before the extruder can move to the initial position.

#### Position of zip ties on the cable-holder

Make sure the zip ties are situated exactly like instructed in the assembly manual. You want the top zip ties on the very top (green arrows) or cleanly against the printed _cable-holder_. **Zip ties must not interfere with either end of the axis _Einsy-door_ or the PSU.** Move the extruder to each end and check if the zip ties are touching either end.

The bottom zip ties holding the heater and thermistor cable must also be positioned so they do not interfere with the ends of the axis (purple arrows), but also **do not touch the Heatbed-cable-cover**. Make sure they are cut flush with the head of the zip tie.

### Possible causes for Z-axis

The main end-stop of the Z-axis is the P.I.N.D.A. sensor, so you should first make sure this is not set too high or not working correctly. See [P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA Sensor testing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/p-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing_2091) for more information.

However, more often there is an issue with your assembly, which interferes with the distance traveled. You need to look over your assembly and pay extra attention to **the orientation of the Trapezoid nuts** (Z lead screw). A section of its threads should be inside the printed part, not protruding up from the printed part. The highest point should be the M3 bolts securing the Trapezoid nuts. Also, if the error occurs during calibration, make sure nothing is touching the bed, i.e. a zip-tie on the bundle of cables.

Correct orientation of the Trapezoid nut (Z lead screw).

Another possible cause is that you have loaded an incorrect version of the firmware. For instance, the extruder for the Original Prusa MK3 and MK3S/MK3S+ are of different size, and therefore have a different length of expected travel. **Always make sure you are using the correct firmware.**

For more info on issues with the Z-axis, please see [Failing Z calibration (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/failing-z-calibration-mk3s-mk2-5s_160858).

### Lubrication

Try to lubricate the smooth rods, as instructed in [Maintenance tips](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/maintenance-tips_23200). The Original Prusa MK3S/MK3S+ is supplied with a tube of lubricant.

# [Changing/replacing the nozzle (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/changing-replacing-the-nozzle-mini_134235)

This article will guide you through the replacement of the nozzle on your Original Prusa MINI printer. Note that this requires you to have some tools available and also be careful while changing the nozzle as you might damage the printer or burn yourself.

### Why change the nozzle?

There might be two reasons, why you need to replace the nozzle:

* The nozzle is worn out and needs a replacement.
* You want to print using a different nozzle diameter.



Unless you print abrasive materials with a brass nozzle,

**the stock nozzle will last you many hundreds of printing hours**

. Changing a relatively new nozzle to resolve a clog is not the solution!

The stock 0.4mm Nozzle installed on the Original Prusa MINI

[can be found in the eshop](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/nozzle-0-4-mk3-s-mini/)

. The printer is also

**compatible with E3D V6 nozzles.**

### Preparation

* Get hold of a **16mm spanner** , or an adjustable wrench to secure the heater block, plus **a pair of pliers or a 7mm socket to unscrew the nozzle**. _A very large spanner or an adjustable wrench can quickly drain heat from the heater block and may cause a Thermal runaway error, depending on how it grips the block._
* Get a non-flammable surface to place the used hot nozzle on (i.e. plate or aluminum foil).
* Unload the filament. Optionally, do a [coldpull](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mini_126399).



### Procedure

1. Preheat the nozzle to 280 °C ( _LCD Menu - > Settings -> Temperature -> Nozzle_). **Heating the nozzle is essential for this process!**
2. Gain better access to the nozzle by moving the extruder axis as high as possible ( _LCD Menu - > Settings -> Move Axis -> Move Z)._



Turn off the printer before the next step!

3. Hold the heater block with a 16mm spanner (or an adjustable wrench).
4. Use pliers, or preferably a 7mm socket, to unscrew the nozzle. Be careful, the nozzle is still hot!
5. Place the extracted **hot** nozzle on your non-flammable surface and put it out the way so you don't accidentally touch or lean on it.



**Turn left to loosen the nozzle ( orange arrow). Turn right to tighten it (green arrow).**

6. While the print head is still heated and holding the heater block in place with the spanner, insert the new nozzle and tighten it gently, but firmly. **Do not use excessive force!**
7. As soon as you can't screw the nozzle in anymore, check if there is a slight gap between the nozzle and the heater block (blue marker). More details are explained below.



### Final inspection

There must always be a gap (~0.5 mm) between the nozzle and the heater block (blue marker/Green arrow). **This is important to make sure the nozzle is 'locked' against the heatbreak, creating a seal.** If there is no visible gap between the nozzle and the heater block, it can indicate that the nozzle didn't reach the heatbreak, which can lead to leaks and clogs (red arrows).

Oppositely, if the outside gap is too large (several millimeters), it can change the thermal properties of the hotend, and the printer will struggle to reach and hold the set temperature.

# [SpoolJoin (MMU2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/spooljoin-mmu2s_134252)

If you have spools with just a small amount of filament, and not enough for a print, you do not need to throw them away, or manually change the filament every time it ends. You can use the MMU2S feature of filament depletion, called SpoolJoin.

This feature will automatically switch to the next filament in line, should you run out. In order to activate it, go to _LCD Menu - Settings - SpoolJoin [On/Off]_. Add each spool that you wish to finish on the MMU2S (do not skip any filament slot in between). Once the filament depletes, the printer will unload it and load the next slot.

The function works sequentially in a loop, switching from filament 1 to 2, then 2 to 3, and so forth. The switching occurs when the FINDA sensor detects the current spool is finished. While the printer is going through filament slots, you can replace the spools on the slots that have run out, and when the filament in slot 5 ends, it will go back to slot 1 and continue.

After an unload, there will be filament on the filament slot: even if you are not replacing the spool once it runs out, you'll have to remove the filament leftover by hand. Alternatively, you can do this after finishing the print, choose in LCD Menu - Eject filament - Eject Filament 1/2/3/4/5.

**We recommend turning the SpoolJoin feature off for multi-material prints.** As an example, suppose your multi-material print uses filaments 1 and 2. If filament 1 runs out or run-out is falsely detected, filament 2 will be used in both places, as filament 1 is considered empty.

There is a niche use of SpoolJoin when printing multi-material models. If you have a two-color print and, in PrusaSlicer, set it to use Filament 1 and 3, there is now a spare spool loaded to Filament 2. This will be used when Filament 1 runs out. In addition, Filament 4 and 5 can be loaded before printing with the same intention, substituting for Filament 3.

Filaments are often "secured" to the spool by a bent end (Blue circle). This might make your filament get stuck in the MMU2S PTFE tubes or pull the empty spool. Make sure to cut that end when you are finishing a spool.

# [PrusaLink (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusalink-sl1-sl1s_146094)

Via the web interface called PrusaLink, you can monitor and control your Original Prusa SL1/SL1S over your local network. You will be able to:

* Upload project files.
* Start and stop prints.
* Manage projects on both external and internal memory.
* Info and statistics of most components.
* Manage and see details regarding your current print and its progression, like changing the exposure times or resin refill requests.



The printer must be [connected to your network using Wi-Fi or a LAN cable](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/internet-connection-sl1-sl1s_1981). When your printer is connected to your network it is assigned an IP that you use to access PrusaLink. In addition to this, a username and password are required to enter the platform.

###

### Security

The system is now equipped with an HTTP digest for improved printer security, which is set as a default option. The username and password can be found and adjusted in the printer's menu -> Settings -> Network -> Login credentials.

_Do not use "prusa123" as your password!!!_

The HTTP digest can be turned On and Off using the switch on the top of the Login Credentials page (orange square). The system will then use a simpler API key. However, **this option is not recommended due to security concerns** of the key being sent over the network unencrypted.

PrusaLink is designed to be used on a local (internal) network.

**It is not recommended to access the printer from the internet over a port forward on the router.**

Instead, use an encrypted VPN.

### Finding the printer's IP

Once your printer is connected to the network, you will find its IP address in _Main Menu- > Settings -> Network, under Wifi or Ethernet, depending on how you are connected_.

You can also use a wifi-scanner app like Fing to find the printer on your network and its assigned IP. **The name of the device will be the Hostname of the printer,** default "prusa64-sl1".

#### Access by QR code

You are also provided with a QR code containing your IP, which you can scan for convenient access to the PrusaLink platform. Go to _Main Menu- >Settings -> Network_ and select the method you are connected with, either 'Wi-Fi' or Ethernet.

A QR code to access PrusaLink is displayed. **If connected by Wi-Fi the QR code is found below the list of available Wi-Fi networks.**

### Upload files directly from PrusaSlicer

### One-click print

Once you upload a print/project from PrusaSlicer or PrusaLink it will show up on the display ready to be started. For more information, please see [One-click print](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/one-click-print_220249).

# [Seam position](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-position_151069)

Some options will only appear when

[Expert mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

is selected.

Unless you're printing in the Spiral vase mode, each perimeter loop has to start and end somewhere. This start/endpoint creates a potentially visible **vertical seam** on the side of the object. It's also commonly referred to as zits, layer seams, or scars.

This seam will be especially visible if the shape of the object is cylindrical, without any sharp corners.

In order to hide the seam as much as possible, there are several seam placement options available in
**Print settings - Layers and perimeters - Seam position.**

Starting with PrusaSlicer 2.3, you can use the

[Seam painting tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-painting_168620)

to have detailed control over the seam placement.

### **Nearest (edge)**

Attempts to place the seam on the nearest edge of the current layer. If your model has sharp corners, this will make the seam effectively **invisible**.

To be precise, this will try to choose a concave non-overhang vertex so that the seam is hidden inside of the concave angle. If no concave non-overhang vertices are available, it will choose a convex non-overhang vertex. If none are available, it will choose a non-overhang vertex. The choice among the candidates is operated so that the start point is the nearest to the previous extruder position. So this option will optimize for short travels.

### **Aligned**

This will use the same logic as the **Nearest** for finding the candidates, but it will choose the one that is nearest to the start point of the previous layer. This will ensure the seam is mostly aligned throughout the whole object.

_Random (left) vs Aligned (right) seam position_

### **Random**

This will choose a different point for each layer, making the seam less noticeable at the cost of a less smooth surface (small zits scattered across the surface).

It makes little sense to use Random seam position on models with corners/sharp edges, it's much better to use Nearest or Aligned in such cases. On the other hand, when printing cylindrical shapes without any sharp edges, Random seam position is a viable option.

### **Rear**

Rear works similarly to Aligned, but it will try to position the seam close to max Y (rear of the print bed). It still tries to avoid overhangs and tries to put the seam in the corners.

### How to reduce the visibility of the seam

With the FFF/FDM technology, it is not possible to entirely eliminate the seam. It will always be somewhat visible. However, with well-tuned settings, it shouldn't be too noticeable.

Settings that affect the visibility of the seam are **[Linear Advance](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/linear-advance_2252)** and **[Extrusion multiplier calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extrusion-multiplier-calibration_2257)**. Original Prusa profiles have these settings already tuned, but if you're fine-tuning a custom profile, you can try lowering the extrusion multiplier and calibrating the linear advance value to lower the visibility of the seam.

You can use the **Vase mode** to avoid the seam, but then you'll be limited to using only one perimeter and no infill.

# [NTP Server (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ntp-server-mini_151132)

Starting firmware version 4.1.0, the Original Prusa MINI is able to get the current time using the NTP servers (Network Time Protocol). This feature requires an active connection to the internet and brings a great addition to the running print.

An offline printer reads the duration of the print from the G-code and displays the remaining time on the screen (red arrow left picture). However, when the printer is online (purple arrow right picture) and acquires the current time, it calculates with the print time from the G-code and displays the estimated time of completion.

_Printer **not** connected to the internet_ _Printer connected to the internet_

NTP client sends requests to the server once an ethernet connection is established and then

**updates its inner clock from the NTP servers every hour**

.

### Settings

The NTP servers are not able to retrieve the time zone your printer is in. In order to see the correct time, please navigate to the _Settings - > TZ UTC (+/-)_ and set the number of hours, which will be added or subtracted from the NTP server time.

For example, our HQ in Prague are UTC+2h, therefore the time zone settings have to be adjusted by +2 hours. More info on finding your time zone [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

# [Tune Menu](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tune-menu_151141)

Starting accidentally another action during the print (e.g. XYZ calibration, switching sheet profiles, ...) can cause damage to the printer. This is why during the entire printing phase most of the menu items are unavailable. The safety of the user and the printer is the biggest priority.

However, some parameters can be adjusted (e.g. temperatures, flow, sound mode, ...) and those are shown in a special list called "Tune menu". The list differs from printer to printer and is expanded based on the new features and customer feedback.

**Example of the "Tune menu" on the MK3S:**

**Example of the "Tune menu" on the MINI:**

# [Sound mode (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sound-mode-mini-mini_151152)

The Original Prusa MINI/MINI+ introduces 4 levels of acoustic signalization - **Loud, Once, Silent and Assist**. You are able to choose between each level in the printer's menu _Settings - > Sound Mode_. You can also change the sound settings during the print in the [Tune Menu](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tune-menu_151141).

### Level description

* **Loud** \- printer uses acoustic signalization to notify the users of a failure, filament change during a print, or if confirmation is needed
* **Once** \- this level is similar to Loud, but all beeps are played only once
* **Silent** \- most of the beeps are muted, the user is informed only in case of a serious error
* **Assist** \- a mode for visually impaired users, the printer plays a different sound while scrolling through the menu, and at the end of the menu.



It is also possible to change the sound volume. The range is 0-11 and the default value is 5. If the sound is **Loud** but the volume is at 0, no sound will be played.

If the printer presents an error, the printer will play a sound in a loop until the knob is clicked. This sound will be played independently of your sound settings and volume.

# [Flooded/spilled resin (SL1)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flooded-spilled-resin-sl1_153221)

### How it can happen

The SL1 features a built-in resin level sensor, so in case there’s too little or too much resin, the printer will pause and display an on-screen info message. Because of that, the resin cannot spill during a print due to overfilling the tank.

A protective tray accompanies the Original Prusa SL1. Use it during object removal to prevent any spilled resin on the printer. Around the LCD there is also a small channel designed to prevent smaller amounts of resin to get into the machine.

The resin being spilled is usually the result of an accident. In case any resin is spilled on or into the printer, turn off the printer immediately and disconnect the power cord. Pour any resin still left in the tank into a bottle through the filter before you start the cleanup. The resin needs to be poured in a bottle that offers complete protection from UV lights, like the one provided with the new resin, always poured through the filter.

Always wear gloves when handling resin.

Clean the spilled resin as soon as possible, before it hardens.

### Clean up

Wipe all resin you can see with paper towels. Make sure that there are no drops left. A paper towel with IPA can be used to clean the resin, except in delicate surfaces, like the display and the acrylic lid.

In case there is a larger resin spill or the resin tank floods, soak all the excess resin with a paper towel before cleaning the surface with a paper towel and IPA. Open the [eight screws holding the bottom cover](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-electronics-lid_11824#13320) and check the inside of the printer for any resin that might have spilled. Check if the tilt mechanism and sensor do not have any resin. Use the [SL1 assembly manual](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-electronics-lid_11824#13320) as a guide for accessing the inside of the printer **.**

In case you find any resin on the main-board, motion controller, or UV LED, take pictures of the damage and contact our Support.

After the printer has been cleaned, check your FEP foil for any damage, as this might have been the cause for the resin spill.

If the spilled resin has been cured, it needs to be very carefully scraped off. In case there is cured resin on the inside of the printer, but it is not on any movable part like the tilt mechanism or electronics, there is no need to clean the resin, as more parts may be damaged in the process. Please note that any damage resulting from this process will not be covered under warranty.

We recommend curing the paper towels soaked with liquid resin in a [curing chamber](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/accessories/720-original-prusa-curing-and-washing-machine-cw1.html). Another option is to leave them in direct sunlight to cure the resin, then treat them as plastic waste.

# [Preheat error print head #12202 (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/preheat-error-print-head-12202-mini_154797)

### What happened?

The message **"Preheat error print head"** is shown when the printer is unable to heat up the hotend more than 2 ºC for 20 seconds. The printer starts a safety feature, which instantly kills the heating process and displays the message on the screen. The printer then waits for the user to inspect all parts and if needed fix the issue.

Error name: Preheat error print head

### How to fix it?

Most often, this error happens due to wiring damage or connection issue on the hotend heater cable. Less often might be from the hotend thermistor wiring and connection as well.

#### A visual inspection

Before breaking out the multimeter you should check the print head, where the thermistor (purple arrow) and heater (green arrow) resides, that no wires have broken off the sensor or heater themselves. While the printer is turned off, carefully try to move the wires by hand. If any of them have come detached your search is over and the part needs to be changed. **It is not recommended to solder these wires,** moreover, for the thermistor, it will change it's resistance and thus readings. Spare parts can be found in our e-shop, or you can contact [Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) for assistance.

Also, make sure everything is connected to the Buddy mainboard, inside its case. Loosen the one screw securing the cover (circled in the picture below), remove the top cable cover and flip it open to reveal the board.

Check that all the connectors are secure in their sockets, according to the picture below. Focus on the thermistor and heater cables (blue arrows). Though unlikely, rough shipping or handling could have shaken the heater or thermistor cables loose.

#### Checking the resistance

The table below describes the correct resistance for each part, as well as what scale you should set your meter to. **We have another more in-depth guide on[Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117).** All thermistors are rated to be **100 kΩ at 25 °C.** To be realistic, with a varying temperature between 20 °C and 30 **°** C, **you can expect a wider range of readings (~85-125 kΩ).**

There can be micro-fractures in the cable, breaking the connections only at certain positions. Therefore, try to move the cable a bit while doing the measurement and see if the value changes drastically.

### What happened?

The printer will display "Thermal runaway" for the heatbed if the printer drops the heatbed temperature by 25 ºC for an extended period of time. A general temperature drop would usually not be an issue, but if the heat is not recovered after 45 seconds, the error will appear. In this case, the printer will stop the heating and display the message on the screen. The printer then waits for the user to inspect all parts and if needed fix the issue.

# [Maxtemp error bed #12205 (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/maxtemp-error-bed-12205-mini_154821)

### What happened?

The printer will display "Maxtemp error" for the heatbed if the printer's heatbed temperature goes above 110 ºC at any point. This is a safety feature to prevent printer damage and fire. In this case, the printer will stop the heating and display the message on the screen. The printer then waits for the user to inspect all parts and if needed fix the issue.

Error name: Maxtemp error bed

### How to fix it?

The error might indicate some issue with the wiring, either the heater or the thermistor cables are possibly damaged.

#### A visual inspection

Before breaking out the multimeter you should check the heatbed, where the thermistor and heater reside, that no wires have broken off the sensor or heater themselves. While the printer is turned off, carefully try to move the wires by hand. If any of them have come detached your search is over and the part needs to be changed. **It is not recommended to solder these wires,** moreover, for the thermistor, it will change its resistance and thus readings. Spare parts can be found in our e-shop, or you can contact [Support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) for assistance.

Also, make sure everything is connected to the Buddy mainboard, inside its case. Loosen the one screw securing the cover (circled in the picture below), remove the top cable cover and flip it open to reveal the board.

Check that all the connectors are secure in their sockets, according to the picture below. Focus on the thermistor and heater cables (yellow arrows). Though unlikely, rough shipping or handling could have shaken the heater or thermistor cables loose.

#### Checking the resistance

The table below describes the correct resistance for each part, as well as what scale you should set your meter to. **We have another more in-depth guide on[Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117).** All thermistors are rated to be **100 kΩ at 25 °C.** To be realistic, with a varying temperature between 20 °C and 30 **°** C, **you can expect a wider range of readings (~85-125 kΩ) than with the heater.**

There can be micro-fractures in the cable, breaking the connections only at certain positions. Therefore, try to move the cable a bit while doing the measurement and see if the value changes drastically.

# [LCD screen contrast adjustment (i3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/lcd-screen-contrast-adjustment-i3_154982)

In case you experiencing issues with the screen readability, you can try adjusting the contrast on the LCD-module. On the back of the LCD-module, you will find a small potentiometer dedicated to this. **If adjusted to an extreme, the image of the LCD-module can be entirely burned out, with no visible letters.**

_LCD module adjusted to 4 different levels_

### How to adjust the contrast

Before you dive into the disassembly, ensure once again that the cables are properly connected both to the LCD and to the Einsy board. Some image distortions can be caused just by incorrectly seated connectors.

Be careful, don't use objects with sharp tips, and don't press too hard. You might damage the board!

It may be possible to access the adjustment potentiometer without any disassembly, from below the LCD. However, it may be difficult to adjust when still mounted to the printer. _Your LCD module may be a different color than what is depicted, but the procedure remains the same._

1. Detach the LCD assembly by removing the 4 screws that hold the LCD module (purple arrows). _By sliding the printer to the edge of the table you will have access to the screws from below._
2. Remove the two screws securing the module in the cover (blue arrows).
3. Remove the LCD module from the cover and slide off the LCD-holder (green arrows)


4. You now have access to a small potentiometer on the back of the LCD module (red arrow). Use a small screwdriver to turn the potentiometer. **Turn the printer on to see the contrast change when adjusted.**

# [Adjusting belt tension (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mini-mini_157324)

Loose belts would cause a printer malfunction and prevent proper printing. The easiest way to check is printing a round object - if any of the belts are not tightened properly the result is an irregular shape instead of a perfect circle. Y-axis belt is located under the heatbed, X-axis belt moves the print head.

### Checking the belt tension

If you move each axis to the far right or left, use a finger push the belt down in the center of the axis. Some force should be needed for bending the belt. Careful when pushing so you do not overstretch the belt, as you might damage the printer. Belts should be tight enough to sound like a low bass note when plucked.

### Adjusting the X-axis belt

#### Slight adjustments

Get out your 2.5 mm Allen key:

1. Loosen the two screws as depicted below by turning them **counterclockwise** (left picture).
2. Tighten the two screws at the very end of the X-axis by turning them **clockwise** (right picture). These push directly onto the ends of the smooth metal rods, moving the plastic part with the belt idler, tightening the belt.



Adjusting only one of the two end screws will create a skew in the XZ-axis. However, it can also correct a skew if already present.

3. Once the belt is tight, turn the two side screws **clockwise** to fix the plastic part holding the belt idler, in place.



#### Large adjustments

To access the X-axis belt holder you must remove the heat sink of the print head. This requires some disassembly.

1. Loosen the belt by following the method described above.
2. Follow the guide [How to replace a heatsink (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatsink-mini-mini_121780) to Step 10 to remove the heat sink.
3. Remove the belt from the middle slot (green arrows), move it in 2 - 3 'teeth' (blue arrow), and push it back into the slot, using a 1.5 mm Allen key.
4. Follow the guide [How to replace a heatsink (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatsink-mini-mini_121780) backward from Step 10 to reassemble the print head.
5. Adjust the tension of the belt following the method above.



### Adjusting the Y-belt

#### Slight adjustments

In the middle of the front plate of the heat bed assembly (purple arrows), you will find two screws that will adjust the tension of the Y-axis belt. Use the 2.5 mm Allen key and by turning them **clockwise** you will tighten the Y-axis belt.

#### Large adjustments

If the Y-axis belt is very loose you must move it in the Y-axis belt holder found beneath the bed carriage.

1. Loosen the 2 screws in the picture above by turning them counterclockwise. Do not unscrew them completely.
2. Turn the whole printer over to its side to access the bottom of the printer (left picture).


3. Slide one end of the belt out from the belt holder (right picture), move the belt in 2-3 'teeth'(blue arrow), and push it back into the slot using the 1.5 mm Allen key (orange arrows).
4. Turn the printer back right side up and fine adjust the belt tension with the two front screws (as described in the previous method).

# [How to replace an extruder motor (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-an-extruder-motor-mini-mini_157410)

- Before covering the electronics, make sure the square nut is correctly positioned in the printed part. **The nut must not fall out!** This can cause fatal damage to the electronics.

- Insert the cover back in, make sure it is properly seated in the slot. _Note: on an older design, there are holes instead of slots, the assembly procedure is the same._

-  **Place the second cover on the top and arrange the cables:**

-  **Extruder bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially in. Also, it must be tilted away from the printer.

-  **Heatbed bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially inside the box.

-  **Filament sensor cable** (optional), ensure that the textile sleeve wrapped around the cables is partially inside the box.

- Now, tighten the second cover. Check that no cable is pinched.

# [Custom bed models](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/custom-bed-models_158431)

PrusaSlicer lets you choose a custom STL and use it as the bed model.

You can assign it by selecting **Printer settings - General - Bed shape - Set** and using **Load...** in the **Model** section.

If you save the Printer preset, this custom model will be loaded automatically every time you select it.

### The origin position

The position of the model origin (point with coordinates x:0, y:0, z:0) needs to be in the **middle** of the print bed area. If you load a custom model and it appears misaligned, the origin is not set properly.

To edit the origin position, you can use most 3D programs, such as Blender. Place the 3D cursor in the desired origin position, for example, by selecting two vertices in the opposite corner and using (F3) **Snap cursor to selected**. Then right-click the model and pick **Set Origin - Origin to 3D Cursor.**

Then move the cursor back to world origin (F3) **Snap Cursor to World Origin.** And lastly, pick (F3) **Snap Selection to Cursor** with the print bed model selected.

You can now export the STL (File-Export-STL-Tick "Selection only").

A _custom bed model opened in Blender, note the position of the model origin in the middle of the print bed. Also, note the unnecessarily high polygon count_

### Polygon count

Try to keep the polygon count **as low as possible**. The print bed model is visible almost at all times and having a high polygon count will add unnecessary load to your device.

**An example size of a small model:**

50 kB, 1500 vertices, 3500 faces

# [Firmware updating (CW1)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-cw1_158482)

Updating the firmware is **recommended for all users** as every new version brings new features and fixes. To flash the firmware onto your printer, you need:

* Computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
* USB cable, preferably the original included with your printer
* PrusaSlicer and the printer's driver installed (download [here](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/))



To check which firmware version you already have on your printer, power it up and go to _LCD menu - > Settings -> Information_ and you will see the firmware version **. The procedure for installing an older version of the firmware (downgrading) is exactly the same.**

If you want to flash the firmware, the machine must be

**on**

.

### **Preparations**

* **PrusaSlicer and the printer's driver must be installed.** If you do not have this installed, it is found in the Drivers and Apps package available on the same page where you download the latest firmware.
* Enter our [our downloads section](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) and download the firmware (green square). To find the correct firmware, see the name and picture of the printers/upgrades and compare it to your machine.



### Flashing procedure

1. Connect the CW1 using a **MicroUSB cable** to your computer ( **yellow arrow** ). The CW1 must be ON!


2. Unzip the .zip file to a folder on your computer.
3. Open PrusaSlicer, click on the 'Configuration' menu, and select 'Flash printer firmware' (left picture), even when flashing the CW1 firmware.
4. Click on the **Browse** button (green arrow right picture) and choose the .hex file from the location where you have **unzipped** it.
*       * The filename of the firmware for the CW1 is ' **Prusa-CW1-Firmware-en-vx.x.x.hex'** , where **x** is the firmware version number. In the folder, you will find a file for each translation. ' **en** ' refers to English,
5. Make sure the Serial Port field displays the upgrade's name (purple square right picture) and has a COM port assigned (ex. COM3). Click Flash! and let the procedure complete.



If the 'Serial port' field display anything but the name of the printer (ex. usbmodemfa141 or /dev/tty.

_usbmodem_

) you should try another USB port, reinstall the driver or restart your computer.

Use PrusaSlicer exclusively to flash the CW1 firmware.

# [Squaring your MINI](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/squaring-your-mini_158518)

During transport, assembly, or maintenance (like [adjusting the belt tension](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mini-mini_157324)) the printer can become slightly skewed, where one axis may not be perpendicular (90-degree angle) to another. The firmware compensates for some deviation, but the best is to get your hardware squared from the beginning.

**This procedure is ONLY for fully working printers!**

If you have any issues with the self-test or filament extrusion you must correct this before proceeding.

**It is crucial that your printer is assembled according to our instructions.**

Especially important is the alignment of the bed assembly (Y-axis) and buddy case (XZ-axis) and how they are joined together.

Here we will use no special tool, only the parts of the printer and your eyes. There is no need for advanced engineering tools, like feeler gauges or a machinist square. However, **the order in which you check and make any adjustment is crucial** as you will be squaring the machine against itself.

### Procedure

We will be checking the height of the nozzle above the bed after homing at different X and Y-axis positions on the bed. We will do this for one axis at a time and perform any necessary corrections between each test. **Do not deviate from the order outlined below.**

**We will inspect and correct the printer in the following order:**

1. Initial checks
2. Y-axis
3. YZ-Axis
4. XZ-axis



### Initial checks

* The smooth rods of the X-axis are inserted all the way to the extruder plastic parts (left picture). _X-end and extruder parts have inspection holes to check_ (green circle) _._
* The 10mm linear bearings of the Z-axis are slightly below the plastic parts (~0.75 mm) that secure them and equal on both bearings.
* The foam pad legs are [stuck only to the aluminum extrusions](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/building-your-mini_177717#178047), and not to the plastic front/back plate.
* **Make sure the heatbed and nozzle are cooled down to room temperature!**



### Checking each axis

Start by removing the flexible steel sheet. This is a laser-cut square and we will use it for a later step. Then home the printer from _Calibration - > Auto home_, on the LCD menu and Disable steppers by restarting the printer using the button on the LCD module or by navigating to _Settings - > Disable Steppers_.

**DO NOT turn the printer off.**

Moving the axis fast while the printer is off can damage the TMC stepper drivers.

#### Y-axis

Any noticeable deviation in this step is very rare but ensures following tests and done on a flat surface. If you do find any deviation above ~0.5-1 mm, continue through the whole procedure, then do this check again before contacting support.

1. With the steppers disabled, slide the tip of the nozzle to the center dotted line with the printed "100" mm mark.
2. Turn the threaded rod of the Z-axis by hand to move the nozzle closer to the bed (~1mm), so it is almost touching it (purple ruler).


3. While looking at the distance between the nozzle and heat bed, slide the bed from one extreme to another (green arrows) and see if there is any deviation. _Make sure you do not push down on the bed while sliding it!_



Be careful not to adjust the nozzle too close. It might scratch the heatbed when it is moved.

#### YZ-axis

This checks the bed (Y-axis) against the Z-axis, ensures the smooth X-rods are parallel, and perpendicular to the Z-axis with the nozzle pointing directly down.

1. While steppers are still disabled, move the print head to the right of the X-axis.
2. Move the heatbed to the front of the printer.
3. Navigate the LCD menu to _Settings - > Move axis -> Move Z_ and turn to knob clockwise until the print head/X-gantry is roughly 100-150 mm above the bed.
4. Place the steel sheet vertically on the bed, with the rear notch facing down. When pushed against the X-axis rods, the steel sheet should touch both smooth rods simultaneously.


5. If they do not touch simultaneously, carefully twist the X-end plastic part so they do. _You may have to loosen the[two screws on the side of the X-end](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4ef38bd031052e43_painted-1536x1152.jpeg), securing it to the rods, to smoothly twist it._


5. Navigate to _Settings - > Disable Steppers,_ and move the print head to the left of the X-axis.
6. Confirm this two more times with the steel sheet on the printed dotted line next to "50" and "150".



#### XZ-axis

Here we will make sure the nozzle holds the same distance to the heatbed across the full length of the X-axis. [First Layer Calibration (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-mini-mini_229122) will also not have an even thickness across its entire length and be flatter/more squished on one side of the bed and the other.

1. Home the printer ( _LCD menu - > Calibration -> Auto home_) which moves the print head to the far right and close to the bed ( **left picture** ). Notice the distance between the heatbed and the tip of the nozzle ( **purple ruler** **left picture** ).
2. Disable steppers by restarting the printer or navigating to _Settings - > Disable Steppers._



DO NOT turn the printer off. Moving the axis fast while the printer is off can damage the TMC stepper drivers.

3. Slide the print head across the bed by hand to the left and see if there is any change in the distance. **The tip of the nozzle should have the same distance to the print surface across the entire length of the X-axis.**



Using a shim/paper/ thin cardboard to assess the distance between the nozzle and the heatbed can make it easier to spot the difference.

_Printer with an XZ skew to the left._

### XZ-axis correction

We will correct this skew by resetting the Y-axis extrusion. This requires a 3mm Allen key.

1. Home the printer, by navigating to _Calibration - > Auto home_, on the LCD menu.
2. Disable steppers by restarting the printer or navigating to _Settings - > Disable Steppers_.



DO NOT turn the printer off. Moving the axis fast while the printer is off can damage the TMC stepper drivers

3. Using a 3 mm Allen key, loosen the two screws closest to the Z-axis, on the front and backplate (purple and green arrows). _Do not remove the screws, **just loosen them roughly a quarter turn.**_


4. Carefully press/tap the Z-tower towards or away from the bed (blue arrows) depending on the direction of the skew. _You can damage the printer if you use too much force._


5. Move the nozzle across the bed to make sure it has the same distance to the bed across the whole X-axis (green arrow).



_Corrected printer with no skew._

6. Once satisfied, secure the 4 screws on the front/backplate again, which you loosened in Step 3.



**After completing this procedure you must run the[First Layer Calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-mini-mini_229122) again from zero before you start printing!**

### Fine-tuning the XZ-axis

**With a very small deviation** (0.5 - 1 mm / 0.02 - 0.04 in), it can be difficult to dial it in using the method above. Use this method to fine-tune, but it is important that the two end screws do not differ more than 0.5-1mm in how much they protrude.

#### Downward adjustment

1. Turn the two screws on the side of the idler-holder ( **purple arrows** ) **counterclockwise**.
2. Turn the **top screw** on the end **clockwise** ( **top blue arrow** ). This will bring the X arm down, correcting the skew.
3. Secure the idler-holder again by turning the screws on the side **clockwise**.



**Half to a full turn of the end screw is most often enough**

but will depend on your specific case. Tightening it too much can crack the plastic part.

#### Upwards adjustment

1. Loosen the two screws on the side of the idler-holder ( **purple arrows** ) by turning them **counterclockwise**.
2. Turn the **bottom screw** on the end clockwise ( **bottom blue arrow** ). This will bring the X arm up, correcting a slight skew in this direction.
3. Secure the idler-holder again by turning the screws on the side **clockwise**.



Your belt may change tension during the minor skew adjustment procedure. Adjusting the other screw in the opposite direction may counter this. Follow

[Adjusting belt tension (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mini-mini_157324)

# [IR Filament sensor detection (MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-detection-mk3s_159426)

With filament sensor detection, the printer will be able to recognize if the connection with the sensor was interrupted (e.g. broken wire or disconnected cable) and take appropriate action based on your settings.

This feature was activated with firmware version 3.9.0 and **requires revision 0.4 of the IR filament sensor.** The compatible version of the sensor has a red PCB and was introduced in 2019 (picture below).

For those using a printer with a **modified filament sensor** (i.e. with a LED), we are unable to test every possible modification and their feedback, and can therefore not guarantee correct behavior.

_Revision 0.4 of the sensor chip is the only one that is red._

### Possible states

In the _Support - > Fil. sensor_ menu, information about the revision of the sensor will be displayed. Three possible states are defined:

1. 0.3 or older (Not supported)
2. 0.4 or newer (Detected and supported)
3. unknown status (Sensor detection not completed)



It measures the voltage from the sensor which corresponds to a certain state:

* _No filament: 4.2 - 5 V_
* _Inserted filament: 0.1_ _\- 0.5 V_



In the _Support > Voltages_ menu, a new value will now be displayed regardless of the version of the sensor: **“IR: x.xxV”**. This value represents the actual voltage measured on the pin of the filament sensor.

### Settings

In the _Menu > Settings > HW setup > FS action_ you can set the printer's response to an unexpected change in the filament sensor state:

* **Pause** \- Will pause the print and show an onscreen message, awaiting user input.
* **Continue** \- Will ignore the issue and continue printing.



### Detection

The filament sensor detection procedure is an automatic part of the [Self test](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-failed-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2045) or Calibration Wizard. However, if you skip the wizard there is a new submenu found in _LCD menu - >Settings -> HW settings -> Fsensor Detection_. Here the sensor revision recognition can be triggered manually for the MK3S printer. **The MK3S with the MMU2S unit must run the Selftest.**

The process is fully automatic and the printer enables the new feature for the revision 0.4 only when all of the following conditions are met:

* The printer is in an idle state _(e.g. not printing, not heating up, …)_
* Only if the InfoScreen _(home screen)_ is displayed
* The sensor state is either _“Unknown”_ or _“Older version”_
* In the settings menu, the _Filament sensor_ is set to _“ON”_
* The correct voltages were measured (No filament: 4.2-4.6 V - Inserted filament: 0.3-0.5 V) _. If your voltage differs and you have revision 0.4 you should_ [double-check _the connection to the EINSY board_](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-troubleshooting-mk2-5s-mk3s_112226).



In the rare scenario in which you decide to downgrade the 0.4 sensor to an older revision, it is necessary to run the detection procedure, to inform the printer about the change.

# [Failing Z calibration (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/failing-z-calibration-mk3s-mk2-5s_160858)

The size of the extruder and the length of travel of the Z-axis is coded into the firmware. Therefore, if the assembly of the extruder, or the firmware for your extruder, is not correct, the calibration will most likely fail.

### Extruder assembly

On top, the E3D heatsink has protrusions from its profile and running around the whole heatsink. These fit into the extruder body printed part, which has two corresponding notches for these (orange arrows).

The heatsink will fit if placed into both notches, but also when only covering the bottom notch. This will not inhibit the rest of the assembly procedure, but the nozzle will be about 1 cm lower and Z-axis will have a shorter travel-distance than what is expected by the firmware.

_MK3S/MK2.5S extruder body_ _MK3/MK2.5 extruder body_

#### How to check

If you have installed the heatsink too low you will see the heater block protruding down from below the fan shroud. With the correct assembly, only the tip of the nozzle should be visible.

_Hotend installed **correctly** \- Only nozzle visible_ _Hotend installed **incorrectly** \- Hotend protruding_

#### Correct assembly

The top lip of the heatsink is seated in the top notch of the plastic part (green arrows) and both notches of the plastic part are filled **. If this needs to be corrected,** [follow this guide for the MK3S](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-ptfe-tube-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_21664) or [this guide for the MK3](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-ptfe-tube-mk3-mk2-5_17360), to access the hotend after assembly. _Note, that the removal of the PTFE tube shown in the linked guide is not necessary to reseat the hotend._

Hotend installed correctly MK3S _/MK2.5S_ _Hotend installed correctly MK3/MK2.5_

### Assembly is correct, calibration keeps failing

As mentioned, the travel distance of each axis is programmed to the firmware. If you load the MK3S _ **/** MK2.5S_ firmware in the MK3 _/MK2.5_ (non S) machine, the calibration will keep on failing, because the length of the Z-axis coded in both firmware differs. Therefore, **it is crucial** to use the [correct firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk3s-mk3s-mk3_2227) when updating. _MK3S and MK3S **+** uses the same firmware._

The easiest way to see which version you have is to check the extruder. **The MK3S/ _MK2.5S & MK3S+_ has one idler tension screw and the MK3/ _MK2.5_ has two (pictures below). **

# [How to replace a print fan (MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-print-fan-mk3s-mk3s_160876)

- Open one end of the textile sleeve and slide it on the cable bundle leading from the extruder.

- Leave the cables from the hotend out for now.

- Length of the first wrap should be slightly longer than the cable-holder part, about 5 cm is enough.

- Gently twist the sleeve to make it smaller and tighter around the cables, orient the sleeve's seam downwards, then slide the sleeve towards the extruder.

-  **Take 3 zip ties** and insert them into the **lower row** of holes on the cable-holder.

- Twist the sleeve again (without twisting the cables inside) and tighten the zip ties.

**IMPORTANT**

: Cut the remaining part of each zip tie using pliers as closest to its head as possible. Note the correct position of each zip ties's head (slightly off-centre to the left).

# [Experimental menu (MK3/S/+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/experimental-menu-mk3-s-_161213)

The components installed on your printer rely on firmware configuration. To facilitate the use of components sourced from third-party vendors, **firmware version 3.9.1 introduced an "Experimental menu"**. Because different hardware has different specifications, the firmware is now capable of adjusting the defining parameters of some components.

**The experimental menu is for advanced users.**

For a printer with stock parts, there are no changes to the firmware parameters, and no user interaction is needed.

**To activate the experimental menu, navigate to _LCD menu - > Settings -> HW Setup_, then scroll to any menu item and hold the knob for 2-3 seconds.** After a “click” sound, the menu list will have a new option at the bottom, named ' _Experimental'_ (left picture).

Within ' _Experimental'_ you find the following options:

* “Altfan detection” ( _Altfan det._ ) [On/Off]
* E-cool mode [On/Off]
* Fake serial number



### Altfan detection

**This is an option if you are using an alternative fan to the Noctua hotend fan.** The firmware is capable of adjusting the parameters of [pulse-width modulation (PWM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation) for the hotend fan. This is a way to control electrical current, by taking the full voltage and current and turning it on and off very fast at a specific rate, instead of a steady flow of energy. Some fans will require a lower amount of power to run at optimal speed while others need a 100% flow of power.

For a printer with stock parts, there are no changes to the firmware parameters, and no user interaction is needed. When a printer is run for the first time after the assembly, or [a full factory reset](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mk2s-mk2-5s-mk3s_2216), the firmware will automatically detect the fan and set the appropriate PWM value. This value is stored permanently in the EEPROM memory and remains even after a firmware update. It can be only deleted by performing a full factory reset.

For modded printers not using the stock fans, the user has to intervene only if the factory reset is performed, because the printer might not be able to set a correct PWM value for a given third party fan. By turning the Altfan detection off, the printer will run the fan at 100% power.

Setting a specific custom PWM value is currently not possible.

### E-cool mode

Our developers have discovered that using StealthChop without the “current feedback” feature of the TMC2130 stepper drivers positively affects the extruder motor's temperature. **Multiple tests on our farm have shown that the temperature can be lowered by up to 10° C.** This configuration is called E-cool mode and **will work in both[Normal and Stealth power-mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/power-modes_2213).**

**This feature was tested only for the motors provided by Prusa Research!**

We cannot guarantee that this current amplification can be applied to other 3rd party motors as they might get damaged due to a current spike. For this very reason, the feature is disabled for all printers and has to be manually enabled at the user's risk.

### Fake serial number

From firmware version **3.11.0** a motherboard serial number check has been added. This is related to remote printing services like PrusaConnect/Link, Repetier, or Octoprint.

Einsy RAMBo boards that do not come from Prusa Research will not have a serial number burned in. This includes boards purchased directly from Ultimachine or 3rd party clone boards.

To pass a serial number check, this functionality will write a ‘fake’ serial number to the board’s EEPROM so it's not blank. Without it, you can run into a timeout issue when connecting to these services.

Do not use this function if you are running a genuine Prusa Einsy board! It can affect the printer’s ability to use certain remote printing services.

If you activate this function unintentionally, you can perform a factory reset to load the original serial number to the Einsy EEPROM again.

# [Ambient temperature check (MK3/MK3S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ambient-temperature-check-mk3-mk3s_161230)

The [Einsy board](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/einsy-rambo-electronics-wiring-mk3-mk3s-mk3s_2107) of your printer is equipped with an NTC thermistor, which is used to measure the surrounding ambient temperature. The sensor is located right above the main power connector at the bottom of the board. From the firmware 3.9.1, two error states can occur “AMBIENT_MINTEMP” and “AMBIENT_MAXTEMP”.

If any of these errors are presented, do not operate the printer and contact

[Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287)

.

#### AMBIENT MINTEMP

The “AMBIENT_MINTEMP” error temperature threshold is set to -30 °C. It is used to check whether the thermistor works correctly, ensuring that the second “AMBIENT_MAXTEMP” state will be triggered correctly. In the rare scenario that this error occurs, **all printer operations will be halted**.

#### AMBIENT MAXTEMP

The “AMBIENT_MAXTEMP” error temperature threshold is set to 100 °C. If this temperature is reached, the printer will immediately cut power to the heaters and motors to reduce power draw. **Resuming the print is not possible** until the issue is resolved.

# [How to replace a hotend (MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-mk3s-mk3s_161575)

- Use two zip ties and push them through the upper slots on the cable-holder.

- ATTENTION! Before tightening the zip ties add the cables from the hotend. Use the channel in the printed part to arrange them properly.

- Once the hotend cables are included, tighten the zip ties and cut remaining parts.

- Open the textile sleeve and insert the cables from the hotend.

- Compare the look of the cable management with the last picture.

The zip tie arrangement was tested with the injection molded double spool holder (provided in the kit and assembled later on). If you intend to use any other frame mounted type holder, make sure the zip ties won't crash into it, which might result in a print failure.

# [Noisy filament sensor (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/noisy-filament-sensor-mini_162222)

An optional accessory for the Original Prusa MINI is [its filament sensor](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/mini/1016-filament-sensor-mini-assembly.html). It uses a simple sensor mechanism to detect whether a strand of filament is inserted or not.

The mechanical lever that triggers the sensor, is attached by one M3x12 screw which is also its hinge. If this screw is tightened too much the sensor can be noisy or not trigger consistently.

### How to fix it

The fix is to release the tension on the screw slightly. The hinge screw is accessible when the filament sensor is fully assembled and is the middle screw found on one side of the sensor (purple circle). When tight, release the screw by **one full turn, to one and a half turn.** There should not be any resistance when inserting the filament.

### Testing the lever by hand

If you need to test the movement of the lever (green arrows), you can access the mechanism by removing the two M3x12 screws on each end of the sensor, which secures the cover (blue circles).

# [NTP server (SL1)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ntp-server-sl1_162232)

The SL1 has its own internal Real-Time Clock. Using an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server, the SL1 is able to update the printer's set time when connected to the internet. This time is used to provide you with an actual estimated time of completion, not just the running time of your print.

NTP client sends requests to the server once an internet connection is established and then

**updates its inner clock from the NTP servers every hour**

.

If the printer is connected to the internet, you can make sure that you always have the correct time by entering:

# [How to replace an IR-sensor (MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-an-ir-sensor-mk3s-mk3s_162262)

**The fan has two sides**

, one has a Noctua sticker. Make sure, this side is facing inside the extruder.

- First, create a loop on the cable. Make sure the black protective wrap is close to the edge of the fan. See the picture.

- Place the fan on the extruder and proceed in the following way:

- Start by placing the fan's cable in the upper channel.

- Slide the fan close to the X-carriage and GENTLY PUSH the cable in using an Allen key. Before you push the fan all the way to the left, place the cable in the X-carriage channel.

**Make sure no cable is pinched.**

- Use the three M3x14 screws to fix the fan in place. Don't over tighten them, you can break the fan's plastic casing. Also make sure the fan can rotate freely.

- Insert and tighten the M3x20 (M3x18) screw to the fourth hole in the hotend fan.

# [MMU2S and soluble materials (PVA/BVOH)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-and-soluble-materials-pva-bvoh_162860)

Supports can be hard to remove and leave imperfect surfaces above them. Depending on the shape of the object, there is also the risk of ruining the print in the process. Some geometry is not even possible to print as a single piece using FFF printing.

With the MMU2S it’s possible to use water-soluble materials, like PVA+ and BVOH, to print the supports or just the 'interface' between the print and the support structure. However, printing solubles can be demanding and requires some considerations along the way. **It is a process more suitable for advanced users.**

### Which material to use

The first consideration is that **the main material and the soluble support material must have similar melting/printing temperatures.** [PVA+](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/special/169-primaselect-pva-soluble-support-500g.html) and [BVOH](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/special/161-verbatim-bvoh-soluble-support-05kg.html) are similar in many ways, but BVOH is absolutely the better (but more expensive) option. It is stiffer and will behave much better than PVA+ when printed. This is why it is better to be printed with PETG.

**For PETG you can practically only use BVOH. PLA can be printed with both PVA+ and BVOH.**

If you wish to print ABS with soluble supports, your best alternative is HIPS, which can be dissolved using

['Limonene'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limonene)

. Make sure you read up on the different types of 'Limonene' and the health and safety considerations when using it. One alternative to PVA+ and BVOH could be PVB, which dissolves in IPA.

### Slicer configuration

There is a specific configuration for the soluble support materials in PrusaSlicer. Once you have selected the Original Prusa MMU2S printer profile, you will find some new options in the ' _Print Settings_ ' drop-down menu. For 0.15 mm and 0.2 mm layer height, you now have the additional **SOLUBLE FULL** and **SOLUBLE INTERFACE** (purple squares).

#### SOLUBLE FULL

This option will use the soluble material for the entire support structure (left picture). **This is recommended where you have complex geometry that requires a lot of internal supports only.** PVA+ and BVOH adhere poorly to the Smooth PEI or Textured steel sheet but will adhere well when printed directly onto PLA and PETG. If you are printing something with supports on the build plate, we recommend the SOLUBLE INTERFACE preset.

#### SOLUBLE INTERFACE

This preset applies the soluble material only in the more densely printed layers between the actual support structure and the model (right picture). This allows you to prints the support structure with whatever color is loaded and only uses the soluble material where it is needed. This will save soluble material, which is more expensive than PLA and PETG. **If you have a print that requires a lot of support directly on the steel sheet, this is the option preset for you.**

_SOLUBLE FULL - Green filament is BVOH_ SOLUBLE INTERFACE - _Green filament is BVOH_

#### Default tool

PrusaSlicer or the MMU2S will not detect where you loaded the soluble filament. **PrusaSlicer will default to assign the support material or interface material to Filament number 5.** You can change this to any other filament by entering the number of which the filament is loaded (purple squares).

_'Support material/raft/skirt extruder: 0' will use whatever tool is currently loaded to the extruder._

#### Purging volumes

By default, 70 mm³ is used for both loading and unloading. **When using water-soluble supports we suggest using at least 100-120 mm³.** If you find any residue in your print, increase the amount. PVA+/BVOH may require at least 120 mm³ when unloaded.

To access the settings for purging volumes, press the Purging volumes... button (green arrow).

### Printer and MMU2S configuration

It is essential that you have performed a [very precise IR sensor calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-calibration-mmu2s_2245). With the properties of PVA+ and BVOH, their diameter can easily deform with excessive pressure from the idler.

Again, due to their soft properties, the filament tips will inevitably string, so it’s important to keep an eye on them and be ready to intervene and cut them while the main filament is being printed.

The difference in Max Volumetric speed: PLA has a max volumetric speed of 15 mm³/s, while PVA+, and BVOH have 4 mm³/s. This increases the total print time.

### Dissolving and removing supports

When the print is complete and **before removing the supports** , **immerse it in warm water (maximum 45 °C) and leave it there for a few hours to overnight**. After this, the supports should come off pretty easily but may require some use of tools, depending on your print's geometry. It may help to remove as much of the supports as possible while still dry **.**

Once the printed object is free from the supports, immerse it in hot water again for 10-20 minutes and then brush it to remove the residual debris of PVA+/BVOH. **Using a small tough toothbrush can be an ideal tool for this task.**

Unless you are dissolving several kilos of PVA/BVOH per day, you can pour the resulting BVOH/PVA-solution down the sewer.

### Handling and storing soluble filaments

As you might have expected, both BVOH and PVA are very hygroscopic (easily absorbs water) and should be kept as dry as possible. **PVA+ or BVOH should not be exposed to humidity.** It must be placed right back in its zip-lock bag right after its usage, and always with one or more bags of silica. Otherwise, **it will deteriorate in a matter of a few months and go soft at a much lower temperature,** starting trouble already at the loading process.

When deteriorated like this it will quickly cause loading/unloading issues and your hotend to clog. The best approach is to [print and store these materials in a Drybox](https://www.prusaprinters.org/cs/prints/4583-spool-holder-and-drybox-for-enclosure-v2-with-humi).

- Open one end of the textile sleeve and slide it on the cable bundle leading from the extruder.

- Leave the cables from the hotend out for now.

- Length of the first wrap should be slightly longer than the cable-holder part, about 5 cm is enough.

- Gently twist the sleeve to make it smaller and tighter around the cables, orient the sleeve's seam downwards, then slide the sleeve towards the extruder.

-  **Take 3 zip ties** and insert them into the **lower row** of holes on the cable-holder.

- Twist the sleeve again (without twisting the cables inside) and tighten the zip ties.

**IMPORTANT:**

Cut the remaining part of each zip tie using pliers as closest to its head as possible. Note the correct position of each zip ties's head (slightly off-centre to the left).

# [Modeling with 3D printing in mind](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/modeling-with-3d-printing-in-mind_164135)

Modeling for 3D printing presents several interesting challenges. **FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication)** with its layer-by-layer manufacturing process, the orientation and geometry can greatly affect both the aesthetic and integrity of your finished print. Moreover, different 3D modeling software has different terms and methods for achieving different results, so we will go over some basic guidelines when modeling with 3D printing in mind.

### Overhangs and support material

The most important thing to keep in mind while modeling for 3D printing is the need for support material. 3D printers can’t print in mid-air, as each layer has to be laid on top of another one. When designing, keep this limitation in mind and try to avoid creating steep overhangs and extreme angles. That said, short horizontal bridges can be printed without supports.

**A 3D printer can cleanly print overhanging structures with an angle between 45-60 degrees** , depending on your nozzle diameter and settings. The standard diameter for nozzles on desktop 3D printers is 0.4 mm. For smaller nozzles, like 0.25 mm the angle might be less than 45 degrees. If you must have very steep overhangs or free-floating geometry in your design, consider if this will be visible in the final product, as [surfaces above supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/bad-looking-surface-above-supports_1803) will not have the same finish as a side wall or a top fill. You can model in break-away supports, or split your part into multiple pieces (explained in the next section) for a better orientation.

Let’s take a look at an example - you need to design a part of a fence and it’s up to you how the pickets will look. In the pictures below, you can see two ways how to design a fence, if we want to print it in a vertical position. The best solution here will be to print the part horizontally.

### Splitting the model into multiple parts

Both the visual and mechanical properties of your model can be improved by splitting it into multiple parts. This way they can be **optimized for better orientation and place on the print platform.** This way, you can minimize the number of supports required. The parts of the object can then be glued together. [PrusaSlicer has a cut-tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cut-tool_1779) to make this easier. You can also use [Meshmixer to cut the models](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/cut-stl-models-3d-printing-meshmixer_7652/).

When you glue the parts of your object together, make sure that the surfaces to be glued are smooth and free of grease or dirt, to achieve an invisible seam. The [ironing feature](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ironing_177488) in PrusaSlicer can also assist in this. Also, it can be helpful to lightly sand the surface to increase adhesion. The need for sanding will depend on geometry, surface finish, and type of glue. Superglue can be very viscous so it may not be ideal for rough surfaces. It can also leave traces of itself. When you find the right glue for your model and material, the seam should be stronger than the rest of the material, but you might want to model in some pegs for alignment and strength.

On smaller models, the seams from attaching parts together will be more visible than on bigger models.

### Fillet vs chamfer

If oriented towards the print bed, fillets create a very steep overhang, which negatively affects the surface of the object. For this reason, ​use chamfer instead​ if a perfect part finish is a priority. However, you can improve on this using the [Variable layer height function](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/variable-layer-height-function_1750) in PrusaSlicer.

Using a chamfer on the edges of two parts that slot together can save you a lot of effort when assembling.

### How many sides does your cylinder/circle have?

Bear in mind that the modeling software you are using might be showing you a curve, but pay attention to the number of sides that are actually present. When the model is being designed, the visual representation can be smoothed out by the software's shaders, and the print can turn out to be a polygon, not a circle. Make sure you have the correct number of sides/faces on your model.

_Notice how the look of the part changes changing shader ( green arrow). Both pictures are of the exact same geometry. The right picture shows how it will look printed._

### Thin walls and minimum feature size

Another limitation is the nozzle diameter. The most common size and stock nozzle size on MK3S is 0.4 mm, which in PrusaSlicer has​ an extrusion width of 0.45 mm​. PrusaSlicer can improve upon this in multiple ways. However, it may be wise to keep these numbers in mind, especially when you’re designing thin walls or tiny features. Walls thinner than one nozzle perimeter is not printable.

**0.4 mm nozzle** **Wall thickness**
1 perimeter0.45 mm*
2 perimeters0.9 mm*
3 perimeters1.35 mm*
4 perimeters1.8 mm*

_*These are approximations and may vary depending on the slicer settings._

As a way of improving the perimeters, you can go in the PrusaSlicer to the _Print Settings tab - Layers and perimeters_ , and check the option "Detect thin walls". This will merge two paths into a single-pass extrusion. However, walls thinner than one perimeter can not be "repaired" this way.

**Wall thickness** **Is it printable?**
Less than one perimeter
One perimeter
More than one perimeter, but less than two perimeters
More than two perimeters

### Tolerances

When modeling parts that should fit together, **you need to include a certain amount of tolerance.** You will probably not be able to slot together two parts with zero-tolerance dimensions. You may have to tweak the tolerances until you reach an optimal result. There’s no single “universal” value - it all depends on different factors, which most common are:

* Size of the model
* Horizontal or vertical orientation
* The geometry of the parts that should interlock
* Calibration
* Settings
* Properties of the material



An Original Prusa will be accurate to at least 0.2 mm, but you also need to remember that different materials can warp or shrink during printing. **Consider if two parts should move, like a hinge, or lock/snap together with a friction fit. An initial good measurement for movable parts is at least 0.3 mm.**

The PrusaSlicer feature 'Elephant foot compensation' can improve the tolerances of some areas. You can read more about it here:

[Elephant foot compensation](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/elephant-foot-compensation_114487)

### Fine details and material consideration

If you have specific conditions for your design, like being outdoors or in a hot environment, this affects your material choice, which in turn can affect your design decisions. In short, **filament properties should be taken into consideration.** For example, in order to make designs/models that will need to either be outdoor or have high mechanical resistance, those should be printed from PC, ASA, PETG, or similar. Those filaments may not print small details as well as PLA. So when modeling a piece that is meant to endure outdoor weather conditions or mechanical strain, you may want to avoid using small details.

### Iterations of your design

You will have to make test prints before you can consider it final. **While developing your design, prepare to make tweaks and adjustments to your tolerances and geometry.** [Having a parametric approach in CAD helps immensely](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/parametric-modeling-in-fusion360_37411/), but if you are just starting out, try to not set your design in stone and save versions along the way, before you, for example, merge multiple objects together and/or create holes/cavities that should fit something else (subtractions).

### Orientation on the print bed

A surface printed directly on the print bed is perfectly flat and smooth, while a surface printed above supports will look more inconsistent and rough. The picture shows the worst-case scenario for demonstration purposes. [There are ways to mitigate this](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/bad-looking-surface-above-supports_1803), but surfaces with a lower overhang angle look much better even with supports.

Like wood, **FFF prints are stronger in one direction than another.** Therefore, you want structural parts to be printed in an orientation that optimizes their structural integrity. More info on the impact of the orientation of your print can be found in the video below.

### Make sure it is manifold/solid

The model to be printed must be solid or have "manifold geometry". This is a geometry that can exist in the 3-dimensional real world. If a model has holes on the surface or internal geometry, the part will not be able to be sliced.

Most design programs have a feature dedicated to correcting this error under different terms like "make manifold" or "Cap holes". These options will most often delete excess faces, edges, and vertices, and fix or create surfaces where they are missing. You can also see our guide about [Corrupted 3D models for printing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/corrupted-3d-models-for-printing_2205).

### Multi-material printing and dual extruders

In order for a model to be printed using the [MMU2S upgrade](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/upgrades/183-original-prusa-i3-mk25smk3s-multi-material-2s-upgrade-kit-mmu2s.html) or a printer with dual extruders, please note that each different color needs to be exported as a different mesh. That can be done by having each mesh in a separate 3D file (stl, obj). You can also have multiple meshes in an amf or [3mf file](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/saving-projects-as-3mf_1773). PrusaSlicer will assign each different mesh to a different color. If you have each mesh in a different file, you will need to import all of them at the same time. We mentioned earlier making a model manifold or solid. **In this case, you will need each part of the whole to be manifold/solid.**

It is possible to have one single mesh and splitting it using [Meshmixer](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/splitting-stl-using-meshmixer-old_87016), but it can be a very long and tedious process. Therefore, this might be helpful to keep in mind during the design process.

### Using PrusaSlicer for certain elements

As we touched upon in the part regarding the orientation of the print, a lot can be done in PrusaSlicer after the modeling process is done in your modeling/CAD software. Some operations may be quicker to just do in your slicer, than editing your model for then to export it again or if you don't have access to the original project files.

You can use the PrusaSlicer for small modifications in the model. You can use [modifier meshes](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/model-with-prusaslicer-modifier-meshes-tutorial_30438/) to make patterns on the model. You can also add or remove parts of the geometry.

# [Tilt homing failed #10101 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tilt-homing-failed-10101-sl1-sl1s_165754)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **Tilt homing failed, check its surroundings, and repeat the action**.

Error name: Tilt homing failed

Issued when the printer has a mechanical failure when trying to move the tilt mechanism.

### How to fix it?

The inability to home the tilt might indicate that there is a physical block of the tilt mechanism or an assembly error in the motor and the connecting rod. Please follow these steps to check the tilt assembly.

1. Open the eight M3x5b screws securing the cover. **Be careful to unplug the USB & Power-cable before removing the cover completely.**


2. Remove the M4x10 screw holding the right side of the touch screen. It is not necessary to remove the left screw. Just loosen it about a half-turn and you can slide the screen out, like a door. This will give you access to the motor and connecting rod.



Be very careful with the touch screen flat cable. It is fragile and can be easily damaged or cut.

3. Move the connecting rod with your hands and see if it has a full range of motion and if the blade sensor-trigger is between the two sides of the sensor. If so, jump to step 12. If any resistance is found, continue with the next step.


4. Remove the M3nN-nut from the screw that connects the tilt-mechanism and the connecting rod. You can do that by using a spanner or pliers to hold the nut and an Allen key to unscrew from the other side.


5. Remove the two M4x8 screws securing the tilt-motor holder to the bottom plate.


6. Remove the motor-holder and the connecting-rod from the tilt mechanism.
7. Go to [Step 18](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544#9384) of [2\. Base & Tower](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544) of the assembly guide, and remake the connection of the connecting rod and the motor shaft.



Pay extra attention to this step, as not aligning the connecting rod with the protrusion on the holder as instructed will cause the issue again.

8. Reassemble first the tilt to the connecting rod, make sure that after tightening the nut the two parts are in contact.



Do not over-tighten the nut!

9. Connect the motor holder to the bottom plate using the M4x8 screws.


10. Make sure that the optical sensor cable has its correct end connected to the sensor. The middle wire should be blue. In case the middle wire on the sensor connector is black, the connection will need to be swapped.
11. Move the connecting-rod manually and see if it moves smoothly until the blade sensor-trigger is between the two sides of the sensor.



Make sure the sensor is secured!

12. Slide the LCD back to its place, and tighten both M4x10 screws holding it.


13. Connect the USB and Power cable and close the eight M3x5b screws that hold the cover. Tighten them diagonally at first, and add all the screws before tightening them. Pay attention to the cables from the electronics so that they are not pinched.


14. Run the wizard again.

# [Polycarbonate (PC)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/polycarbonate-pc_165812)

### Basic info

Polycarbonate (PC) is a technical material with

**great tenacity, tensile strength, and heat resistance**

. However, it’s very hard to print, therefore suitable mainly for advanced users. However, this doesn't apply to our

[**Prusament PC Blend**](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-pc-blend-urban-grey-970g/)

, which is significantly easier to print compared to other polycarbonates.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 275 °C

**Recommended bed temperature:** 110 °C for the first layer, 115 °C for other layers

**Heatbed:** Powder-coated TXT or satin sheet with a glue stick will provide the best adhesion. Note that while the powder-coated satin sheet works perfectly without a glue stick, it is recommended to use a separation layer to prevent surface wear.

### **Description**

**Polycarbonates (PC)** are a group of polymers excelling in their **tenacity, tensile strength, and temperature resistance.** Outside of the 3D printing world, they are used for example for making CDs, protective glasses and shields, or car headlight covers.

**Pure polycarbonate** is not suitable for 3D printing because of its bad surface adhesion and significant thermal expansion. Prints tend to deform and crack. For this reason, various additives are usually added to improve printability. The result of our own development is the [**Prusament PC Blend**](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-pc-blend-urban-grey-970g/) **.** It has relatively **great printability** and is suitable for making **technical parts** with high mechanical and temperature resistance.

**We do not suggest using PC on a smooth PEI sheet.**

Its great adhesion might damage the surface! If you have to, use the Gluestick as a separation layer.

The main disadvantage of most polycarbonates is that they’re extremely hygroscopic (they absorb moisture). They should be stored in airtight containers with desiccant (silica gel) and should be dried in the oven prior to printing.

Some manufacturers counter this with various additives, for example, [**Prusament PC Blend**](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-pc-blend-urban-grey-970g/) tends to absorb moisture **much less than other polycarbonates**. Because of its high-temperature resistance, PC is a suitable material for printer fan shrouds.

Polycarbonate requires **some experience** to print properly. If you are a beginner, consider experimenting with easier materials like [**PLA**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pla_2062) or [**PETG**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/petg_2059) first.

To compare supported material properties, see our [**material table.**](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ High-temperature resistance

✖ Pure polycarbonate is highly hygroscopic

✔ High impact tenacity and tensile strength

✖ High nozzle and bed temperature

✔ Pure polycarbonate is transparent

✖ High warping, especially with large models

✔ Good electric insulation properties

✖ Moderate odor during printing

✖ Application of a separation layer is recommended

### Best use

The best use of PC is for printing technical parts requiring great heat and mechanical resistance.

### Tips for successful printing

**Consider using an enclosure**

Printing polycarbonate is often tricky, as it tends to warp a lot, even with the additives. Printing inside an enclosure helps. Polycarbonate needs to be printed on a special surface, for example, a powder-coated sheet with a glue stick, PEI, or Build-tak. For small to medium objects, you can increase infill to >25% and add more top layers (4 or more) for a stronger print. However, this is not recommended for large prints, where we recommend reducing this.

**Use a Skirt in PrusaSlicer**

If you don’t have a printer enclosure, we suggest placing the object in the middle of the printing platform and setting the skirt value as high as possible. This will make a microclimate with a slightly higher temperature around the model and increase your chances for a successful print.

**Add Brim around small objects**

You should use the [**Brim function**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/skirt-and-brim_133969) for printing parts with a small contact area with the print surface.

**Polycarbonate is not suitable for printing large objects covering the whole sheet.** Prints with round edges warp less than those with sharp edges (this is true for any type of filament). Warping is also affected by infill density and the number of [**perimeters**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748). Denser infill (and more material inside the object in general) increases warping - and a risk of separation from the print surface. A lesser number of perimeters increases the chances of a successful print of large polycarbonate models.

**Do not print in cold areas**

In some cases, the printer might show a “Bed thermal runaway” error. This typically occurs with ambient temperatures below 18 °C when the printer cannot hold the high heatbed temperature.

**Careful print preparation is a key**

Prusament PC Blend is easy to print compared to other polycarbonates. Print preparation is also quite easy. Recommended nozzle and bed temperatures are 275±10 °C and 110 ±10 °C. PC Blend is printable on the powder-coated TXT sheet if you apply glue stick on it. If you print without a glue separation layer, you risk damaging the print sheet. This issue was moderated with the **powder-coated satin sheet.** This surface doesn't need any separation layer if you print with PC Blend occasionally. If you print with polycarbonate regularly, we still suggest using glue stick to keep your satin sheet in the best shape possible.

You can see how to prepare each steel sheet for your filament in our

**Composite materials** filled with **metal or wood powder** are usually **PLA** filaments. The additives give them a special look and properties. They are hard to print due to a higher risk of clogging the nozzle. Metal-filled filaments also require a hardened nozzle.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 190-220 °C (depending on filament type)

**Recommended bed temperature:** 60 °C

**Heatbed:** Smooth PEI sheet will provide the best adhesion.

[Wood or metal powder-filled filaments](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/wood-metal-filled/) serve mostly for **aesthetic purposes** , imitating the chosen material (wood or metal). However, note that they have **much worse mechanical resistance** and layer adhesion than non-modified filaments. The basic material is usually [PLA](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pla_2062), which is known for easy printability, but inferior chemical, mechanical, and heat resistance.

Metal-filled materials are highly abrasive and require

[a hardened steel nozzle](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/different-nozzle-types_2193#hardened-steel-nozzle-by-e3d)

. For wood-filled materials and other composites with large particles, we also recommend using, minimum, a 0.6 mm nozzle, and 0.2 mm layer height to prevent clogging.

Due to the brittleness of these filaments, we do not recommend printing them with the MMU2S upgrade.

To compare supported material properties, see [PLA](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pla_2062). Metal filaments can be **polished** to reach an authentic metal look (but not mechanical properties). Polish metal-filled materials in a similar way you would do it with transparent parts: gently sand the surface with wet sanding papers with 600-1500 (or higher) grit, start with the roughest, and end with the finest. Then use polishing paste and a piece of cloth. Remember that powder-filled filaments have inferior mechanical properties and layer adhesion. If your print has some protrusions and surface details, they can break easily.

# [CPE](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cpe_166877)

### Basic info

**CPE is a material suitable for prototyping various mechanical parts.** Its qualities are similar to PETG, it being odorless and its low warping. CPE has good chemical resistance, layer adhesion, and print surface adhesion.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 275 °C

**Recommended bed temperature:** 90 °C

**Heatbed** : Using powder-coated TXT or satin sheet is highly recommended. Printing on the smooth PEI surface might damage the sheet.

### Description

[**CPE**](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/cpe/) is a co-polyester based on terephthalic acid. Thanks to its properties similar to PETG or ABS, and good layer adhesion it’s good for printing **prototypes of mechanical parts.** CPE excels in its chemical and mechanical resistance and dimensional stability. Unlike with [ABS](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/abs_2058), there is no strong odor or warping issues. **CPE** is a **chemically and temperature-resistant** material (resistance up to 75 °C). The tensile strength of CPE is similar to [ABS](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/abs_2058). It’s suitable for printing **thin-walled models due to its translucency.** CPE is good for making visual and functional prototypes, mechanical parts, etc.

**Note that CPE sticks strongly to the print sheet and might damage its surface**

when being removed too recklessly. As with

[PETG](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/petg_2059)

, clean the smooth sheet with window cleaner, and consider applying a glue stick.

To compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ Good mechanical resistance

✖ High printing temperature

✖ Too strong print surface adhesion

✔ Good temperature and chemical resistance

✖ Stringing issues similar to PETG

### Best use

The best use of CPE is for printing technical parts requiring good **chemical and mechanical resistance.** CPE is good for making visual and functional prototypes, mechanical parts, etc.

### Tips for successful printing

Most of the print settings are similar to [**PETG**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/petg_2059).

**Do not print on the smooth PEI sheet**

as the adhesion may be too strong!

**Use a textured print sheet**

Make sure the print surface is clean, as described in [our dedicated article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804). It is advisable to use one of the **powder-coated print sheets.** **Do not print on the smooth PEI sheet** as the adhesion may be too strong! If you decide to use the smooth PEI sheet anyway, apply a glue stick on it before printing.

# [Water soluble (BVOH/PVA)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/water-soluble-bvoh-pva_167012)

### Basic info

**BVOH** and **PVA** are special **water-soluble materials** used mainly for printing supports. The model itself is printed from standard materials, like PLA, and the BVOH or PVA supports are then easily dissolved and washed off after printing. These materials need to be stored in a drybox and printed with a multi-material upgrade (or dual nozzle/extruder). It’s a technology more suitable for advanced users.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 195 °C (PVA+), 215 °C (BVOH)

**Recommended bed temperature:** 60 °C

**Heatbed:** Smooth PEI and powder-coated satin sheet will provide the best adhesion.

### Description

[**BVOH**](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/special/161-verbatim-bvoh-soluble-support-05kg.html) (Butenediol vinyl alcohol copolymer) and [**PVA**](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/special/169-primaselect-pva-soluble-support-500g.html) (polyvinyl alcohol) are **water-soluble materials** ideal for printing supports for models with complicated shapes, where the non-soluble supports would be difficult to remove. The best combination of materials is using [**PLA**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pla_2062) **with BVOH or PVA** , due to their similar printing temperatures. Both BVOH and PVA are **very hygroscopic** and should be kept as dry as possible. One gram of BVOH is soluble roughly in 20 g (ml) of water. **BVOH** and **PVA** are **biodegradable non-toxic** materials printed with no odor.

**Always keep these filaments dry.**

Wet water soluble filaments don't stick to the surface, are prone to clogging and entangeling in extruder gears.

The main difference between BVOH and PVA is in its **printability** and **price.** PVA is usually cheaper but it’s more prone to nozzle clogging.. Although both filaments show inferior print surface adhesion, BVOH sticks a little bit better than PVA.

To compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ Good for printing easily removable supports

✖ The filament must be kept dry

✔ Low printing temperature (the same as for PLA)

✖ High risk of nozzle clogging

✔ BVOH & PVA are biodegradable non-toxic materials

✖ Usable only with multi-material printers

✖ Necessity of larger volume of nozzle purging (cleaning)

✖ Poor bridging and overhangs

### Best use

Water soluble filaments are great for [printing easily removable supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-and-soluble-materials-pva-bvoh_162860).

### **Tips for successful printing**

BVOH and PVA are ideally used together with [PLA](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pla_2062) as the material of the main model, because of their similar printing temperatures.

We recommend [making a **drybox**](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/dryboxes-and-alternative-spool-holders-not-only-for-multimaterial-upgrade_30525/) for filaments that require keeping them as dry as possible.

**Adjust distance between supports and the model**

The distance between supports and the model in Z-axis should be set to 0mm. This way you will achieve the best results with bottom layers looking almost as great as the top ones.

**Try to print BVOH or PVA on PLA raft.**

It’s optimal to choose models that don’t require printing BVOH/PVA directly on the print surface. Or creating a raft (1-2 layers) from PLA is also a good choice - BVOH/PVA sticks much better to PLA than to PEI print surface. More information on this in [MMU2S and soluble materials (PVA/BVOH)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-and-soluble-materials-pva-bvoh_162860).

### **Material solubility**

Dissolving BVOH and PVA takes several hours, depending on the amount ratio of material and water, and also on the water temperature (warmer is better, but can not be too hot either). Frequent filament changes can lead to printing residual PLA into the soluble supports. This can prevent the BVOH/PVA from dissolving entirely. This effect can be moderated with an increase of [purging (cleaning) material](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/purging-volumes_125097).

# [HIPS](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hips_167118)

### Basic info

**HIPS** is a tough material suitable for printing large objects or supports for large models printed from ABS, ASA, or PETG. It has good print surface adhesion and can be dissolved in limonene (or acetone, although that would melt the ABS/ASA model as well).

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 220 °C

**Recommended bed temperature:** 110 °C

**Heatbed:** All of our (smooth PEI, powder-coated TXT and powder-coated satin) sheets will provide the best adhesion.

### Description

**HIPS** (High Impact Polystyrene) is polystyrene with rubber additives. It has good mechanical properties and dimensional stability. Print and mechanical parameters **resemble** [**ABS**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/abs_2058) **,** but **HIPS** is lighter and **shrinks much less.** It can be dissolved with **limonene (d-Limonene to be specific)** \- therefore is usable for printing soluble supports for more complicated [ABS](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/abs_2058), [ASA](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/asa_1809) or [PETG](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/petg_2059) prints. **HIPS can be sanded,** just as ABS and ASA, plus it can be attached to a print surface with ABS dissolved in acetone - this is not needed when using our print sheets though, as HIPS sticks well enough to PEI surface.

To compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ Good mechanical properties

✖ Printing HIPS supports might be challenging

✔ Limonene or acetone soluble

✖ ABS or ASA might also partially dissolve in limonene

✔ Soluble support material

### Best use

The best use of HIPS is as a soluble support material.

### Tips for successful printing

**Printing supports might be challenging**

Keep in mind that printing ASA, ABS, or PETG with HIPS supports might be challenging if you use [**MMU2S**](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/set-original-prusa-i3-mmu2s-upgrade-kit-for-mk2-5-mk3s/). Are you beginning to print with MMU2S? Try to print with PLA or PETG first to gain some experience, then try to print with soluble supports. MMU2S unit must be well calibrated for printing with HIPS and even then it might need user attention from time to time.

In some cases, HIPS might not stick to the print surface as good as, for example, ASA. In that case, we suggest using the [**brim function**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/skirt-and-brim_133969), especially for parts with a small contact area.

### **Chemical smoothing**

HIPS can be smoothed and **dissolved with limonene and acetone.** However, with limonene, you cannot utilize its fumes (as we do it with ABS or ASA), as it is an oily substance. For successful smoothing, sink the model for several seconds (10-20 s should be enough) into a limonene bath. Then let it dry for at least 24 hours (a slight temperature increase might speed up the drying process). Keep in mind that residual limonene might remain on the surface long after drying and that the model itself will have a citrus smell for a long time.

Although HIPS is being used for printing ABS/ASA/PETG supports and will dissolve completely after long exposure to limonene, it is **not wise to expose it to the solvent for too long.** Some of the ABS and ASA filaments (Prusament ASA Orange for example) are also affected by limonene - it will disrupt the layer adhesion and the model will fall apart into tiny flakes. Instead of dissolving the supports completely, try to just loosen them up by a brief submersion into limonene, then remove the supports manually.

HIPS acetone smoothing is much easier than smoothing ABS or ASA. HIPS layers will melt **almost immediately** (the whole process takes just a few minutes), plus models tend to dry much faster than ASA and ABS - where you can safely touch them sooner.

# [Polypropylene (PP)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/polypropylene-pp_167126)

### Basic info

**Polypropylene (PP)** is a **light material** commonly used for storage and packing in the food processing industry. It’s usable for printing **partially flexible parts**. Due to its high price and difficult printing, **it’s not recommended for beginners.**

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 220 °C

**Recommended bed temperature:** 100 °C

**Heatbed:** Smooth PEI sheet with PP tape will provide the best adhesion.

### Description

In 3D printing, **PP (Polypropylene)** is mostly used for making **hinges, straps, belts,** and other bendable parts. The main disadvantage of this material is its price and **very poor print surface adhesion.** PP has a pretty good resistance against acids, bases/lyes, and organic solvents. PP is lightweight and food-safe (even though regular 3D printing food safety limitations apply). It is translucent in thin layers.

To compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ High chemical resistance

✖ High warping, especially with large models

### Best use

PP is mostly used for making **food safe and bendable objects**.

### Tips for successful printing

Manufacturers usually recommend the following surface preparations: PP foil (PP tape), glass/mirror with Magigoo PP. We recommend using a **smooth PEI sheet with PP tape** and setting a higher temperature for better layer adhesion (but relatively lower for the first layer). Printing PP on the **powder-coated satin sheet** is also possible but be aware that it might adhere less than on the smooth PEI sheet with PP tape.

Temperatures may vary depending on the particular filament brand, but standard values are somewhere between **225-245 °C** for the nozzle and **80-105 °C** for the heated bed. PP is highly prone to **warping,** consider printing in an [**enclosure**](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/mmu2s-printer-enclosure_30215/).

# [NGEN](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ngen_167174)

### Basic info

**NGEN is a material similar to PETG** , but with better printability, high mechanical and chemical resistance, and a wide range of usage from prototypes and aesthetic models to high-tech prosthetics.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 240 °C

**Recommended bed temperature:** 90 °C

**Heatbed:** Using powder-coated TXT or satin sheet is highly recommended. Printing on smooth PEI surface might damage the sheet.

### Description

**NGEN** is made by **ColorFabb** from Eastman Amphora™ AM3300 polymer. **This material resembles** [**PETG**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/petg_2059) (similar print settings) but is a little bit better in some regards. NGEN is for example printable with a wide range of temperatures, is almost odorless, its bridging and overhangs are slightly better than PETG, plus it looks good. You can print functional, resistant, and aesthetically interesting models with it. NGEN is a thermoplastic material, therefore it degrades only a little when being melted again.

To compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ High mechanical, temperature, and chemical resistance

✔ Low thermal polymer degradation when melted

✖ Poor bridging and overhangs

### Best use

The best use of NGEN is similar to [PETG](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/petg_2059) \- mechanical parts for both indoor and outdoor use, or decorative purposes such as lampshades.

### **Tips for successful printing**

**Do not print on the smooth PEI sheet**

as the adhesion may be too strong!

**Use a textured print sheet**

Make sure the print surface is clean, as described in [our dedicated article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pei-print-surface-preparation_2203). It is advisable to use one of the **powder-coated print sheets. Do not print on the smooth PEI sheet** as the adhesion may be too strong! If you decide to use the smooth PEI sheet anyway, apply a glue stick on it before printing.

NGEN has slightly **worse surface adhesion** than PETG - it might not stick as good to the powder-coated sheet. If you print models with a small contact surface, use the brim function.

**Nozzle temperature and print speed**

The manufacturer suggests setting the nozzle temperature according to the layer height and printing speed (optimal setup should be 220-240 °C for 50mm/s and 0.2mm layer height), but you can find a **print profile in** [**PrusaSlicer**](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) **that is tailored for our printers.** 100% print fan speed is not appropriate for the whole print time since it decreases layer adhesion - it’s good to experiment with this.

Material flow can be calculated by the following formula: Flow (mm3/s) = (layer height*nozzle diameter)*print speed.

The manufacturer advises to turn cooling **ON for perimeters** , but **OFF for infill**. The print speed should be slower for bridging.

Retractions should be set a little bit higher and faster than for [PLA](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pla_2062) \- to find out the proper value, start with PLA settings, then adjust them.

# [Polyamide (Nylon)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/polyamide-nylon_167188)

### Basic info

**Polyamide** (Nylon) is a versatile material with **excellent thermal and mechanical resistance.** It is suitable for printing functional technical parts with high temperature and mechanical resistance requirements. However, it’s very hard to print and therefore recommended for experienced users only.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 285 °C

**Recommended bed temperature:** 110 °C

**Heatbed:** Special PA Nylon sheet will provide the best adhesion.

### Description

**Polyamide is an extremely resilient material** , resistant to abrasion, suitable especially for technical parts. It has excellent layer adhesion. In large volumes, it has great mechanical resistance, while in thin layers it remains flexible. Its coefficient of friction is low, **melting temperature is high. However, polyamide is hygroscopic** , so it is necessary to keep it dry (airtight with desiccant). Improper storage can lead it to absorb water weighing up to 10% of filament weight. Polyamides emit a strong odor with potentially dangerous ultrafine particles (UFPs) so printing in a well-ventilated room or in an enclosure is a must.

To compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ Great mechanical resistance

✔ Tough in large volumes, flexible in thin layers

✖ Highly hygroscopic material

✔ High-temperature resistance

### Best use

The best use of polyamide is for printing technical parts requiring **great heat, chemical, and mechanical resistance.** Pure polyamide is also good for making a [cold pull cleaning](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mk3s-mk2-5s_2075).

### Tips for successful printing

Dry the filament before printing, at least 4 hours with a temperature below 90 °C. Moist polyamide filament makes bubbles, which leads to uneven layers and an ugly surface.

**Print it in high ambient temperature**

Print settings are usually quite similar to [PC](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/polycarbonate-pc_165812) \- with nozzle temperature around 285 °C. Apart from moisture issues, **the main disadvantage of pure polyamide is warping**. [High ambient temperature (enclosure)](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/mmu2s-printer-enclosure_30215/) helps a lot. However, you can get polyamides filled with carbon fibers, like our Prusament PA11 Carbon Fiber. These filaments don't warp by far as much as the unaltered versions and can be printed without an enclosure.

# [Composite materials (filled with carbon, kevlar or glass)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/composite-materials-filled-with-carbon-kevlar-or-glass_167387)

### Basic info

**Composite materials** (PLA, PETG, Nylon, PC, or ABS filled with carbon, kevlar etc.) usually have better mechanical properties than unaltered filaments. Composite filaments have **better dimensional stability,** can be **more lightweight,** but are harder to print.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 240-275 °C (depending on filament type)

**Recommended bed temperature:** 75-110 °C (depending on filament type)

**Heatbed:**

Print surface preparation depends on the filament type. See our

[material table](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

to find out more.

### Description

Carbon and kevlar fibers or glass powder are mixed with various polymers in order to **improve their mechanical properties.** It’s usually combined with [**PLA**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pla_2062) **,** [**PETG**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/petg_2059) **,** [**Nylon**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/polyamide-nylon_167188) **,** [**PC**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/polycarbonate-pc_165812) **or** [**ABS**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/abs_2058) \- this increases the filament flexibility, toughness and resistance (with proper print settings). Fibers inside the filament improve its dimensional stability, making it lightweight and less susceptible to warping. Printing temperatures are slightly higher than for unaltered filaments. It is also necessary to count on worse print characteristics, for example **often nozzle clogging, oozing, and filament breaking.**

To compare supported material properties, see our [material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ Good abrasion resistance

✖ A hardened steel nozzle is needed

✔ Similar printing temperature to single material filaments

✖ Worse layer-to-layer adhesion

✖ High risk of nozzle clogging

### Best use

Composite filaments are mostly used for making **RC models** (drone frames, airframes, car parts, etc.), in **the aircraft industry** (functional prototypes) and **automobile industry** (functional prototypes).

### **Tips for successful printing**

Carbon and kevlar fibers are **highly abrasive** so it is necessary to use [a hardened nozzle.](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/hardened-steel-nozzle-e3d-v6/)

**Clean the nozzle before printing**

It’s good to make [**cold pull**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mk3s-mk2-5s_2075) before printing to make sure that the nozzle is really clean.

The first layer should be **perfectly fine** , otherwise, you risk the nozzle clogging. The higher the layer height is and the wider the nozzle diameter is, the lower the chance of clogging the nozzle is. The lowest optimal values are 0.4mm nozzle diameter and 0.2mm layer height.

**Print surface preparation**

Print surface preparation depends on the filament type. See our [material table](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials) to find out more.

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **Tower homing failed, make sure there is no obstacle in its path and repeat the action** **.**

Error name: Tower homing failed

Issue when the printer has attempted to home the tower but has found resistance for moving the tower at the start of the calibration.

### How to fix it?

#### Inspect the assembly

Make sure that the latest [firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-sl1-sl1s_124776) is installed. Check if the three screws indicated in the pictures below are tightened and not moving.

See if there is nothing physically blocking the movement of the tower. In case you cannot find anything blocking it, add a small amount of lubricant to the ball screw.

#### Sensitivity settings

In some edge cases, you must adjust the sensitivity of the platform axis. Navigate the menu to _Settings - > Platform and resin tank_, and find the value for the _Platform Axis Sensitivity ( green square)_. **The default value is Zero.** If the selftest fails when homing the tower, then do the following:

1. **Make sure the value is set to 0 (zero)** and re-run the calibration procedure. If it passes the selftest, then this is all you need to do. If not, see the next point.
2. If you get the same error, **increase the sensitivity to +1** and re-run the calibration procedure. If it passes the selftest, then this is all you need to do. If not, see the next point.
3. If you get the same error, **increase the sensitivity to +2** and re-run the calibration procedure. If it passes the selftest, then this is all you need to do. If not, see the next point.
4. If you get the same error, **decrease the sensitivity to -1** and re-run the calibration procedure. If it passes the selftest, then this is all you need to do.

# [Paint-on supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/paint-on-supports_168584)

PrusaSlicer provides a tool, which lets you paint directly on the object and select areas, where supports should be **enforced** or **blocked**.

The tool is available from the left toolbar and is **only shown in Advanced and Expert modes**. After selecting an object and clicking the toolbar icon, all other objects are hidden so they do not obscure the view, the selected object is rendered in light gray to ensure contrast.

Left-mouse button \- Enforce supports

Right-mouse button \- Block supports

Shift \+ Left-mouse button \- Erase selection

Alt \+ Mousewheel\- Change brush size

### Support generation mode

**Do not forget to enable supports** if you want to actually generate them. By default, support generation is set to **_None_** in the right panel.

#### Enforcing supports

If you're painting support enforcers, it makes the most sense to change supports to **_For support enforcers only._**

Of course, you can also set supports to _**Everywhere**_ or _**From build plate only**_ and use support enforcers to mark additional areas that need to be supported. This second use-case is useful if you set the _Overhang threshold_ very low, so only very steep overhangs will get auto-generated supports.

#### Blocking supports

If you're using support blockers, you should change supports to _**Everywhere**_ or _**From build plate only**_. These modes also turn on _**Auto-generated supports** _in Print settings - Support material. Supports will now be generated based on the set _Overhang threshold_ except for the area blocked by the painted Support blockers.

#### Enforcing and blocking supports at the same time

With very complex models, it's possible you might want to use both enforcers and blockers at the same time. In this case, set supports to _**Everywhere**_ or _**From build plate only**_. You can block some automatically generated supports with blockers while at the same time mark areas which did not get automatic supports with enforcers.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Your selection will not be completely obeyed when the painted region is very small. The support generator itself works on a grid internally, so the supported/unsupported areas are not infinitely detailed.

### Automatic painting

The support painting tool contains an option for the automatic painting of support enforcers on the model.

The algorithm that powers this tool inspects the print extrusion by extrusion, considering a multitude of factors such as the center of mass, weight of the supported part, bed movement, potential extruder collision, bed adhesion, material, and bridging. The result is a more efficient placement of supports. For instance, bridges are supported only by regularly spaced pillars instead of their entire length.

Automatically painted support points

The tool is also automatically activated during slicing, to give you a warning if a print needs supports. As expert users may find such a warning obtrusive, the warning can be disabled in the preferences.

### Highlight overhang by angle

The highlight by overhang angle slider allows you to visualize all triangles that are "more horizontal" than a threshold. This can help you decide where you want to paint enforcers. The overhang triangles are visualized in **real-time** while the threshold is being adjusted.

You can also enable the **On overhangs only** checkbox, which will limit all brush strokes only to the highlighted triangles.

#### Brush

Paints facets according to the currently selected brush.

#### Smart fill

Paints neighboring facets whose relative overhang angle is less or equal to the **Smart fill angle**.

### Brush shape

#### Spherical cursor (default)

Paints everything inside the sphere regardless of whether it is visible or not from the current view. The preferred method for most cases.

#### Circular cursor

Paints all visible places inside the circle from the current view, possibly leaving unpainted areas, but never painting behind corners.

#### Triangles

Paints the whole triangle under the mouse cursor.

### Clipping plane

You can use the clipping plane tool to hide a part of the object, so that difficult to reach areas can be easily painted. Move the slider from left to right to move the clipping plane.

The **Reset direction** button will align the clipping plane tool parallel to the current camera view. E.g. if you want to have the clipping plane moving up-down, look at the model from the top ( **Top view** 1 ) and hit the Reset direction button. The button appears when you move the slider to any non-zero value.

### Undo and Redo

While you have the Paint-on supports tool open, a new undo&redo history is created. You can undo each paint stroke you've made (painting enforcers, blockers, erasing).

Once you leave the Paint-on supports tool, all strokes from the last painting session are merged into one step in global undo and redo history.

### Saving Paint-on supports to 3MF

When you use **File - Save project** the generated 3MF file will include all Paint-on supports information. That means you can customize the painted supports in the future once you re-open the file in PrusaSlicer.

This is really useful if you want to **share your model**. Other people will be able to use your painted supports and modify them freely.

# [Seam painting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-painting_168620)

This tool is available from **PrusaSlicer version 2.3.**

Unless you're printing in the Spiral vase mode, each perimeter loop has to start and end somewhere. Furthermore, the printer has to stop extruding for a brief moment when the print head moves up to the next layer. This start/endpoint creates a potentially visible **vertical seam** on the side of the object. It's also commonly referred to as zits, layer seams or scars.

You can set the [Seam position](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-position_151069) in the Print Settings to try and hide the seam in a corner, randomize the seam position or align it with the back of the model.

The seam painting tool provides more detailed control over the seam placement. The tool is accessible from the left toolbar and it is **only shown in Advanced and Expert modes**. After clicking on the icon, the user can paint 'Seam enforcers' or 'Seam blockers' on the model in a similar way to [Paint-on supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/paint-on-supports_168584).

Left-mouse button \- Enforce seam

Right-mouse button \- Block seam

Shift \+ Left-mouse button \- Erase selection

Alt \+ Mousewheel\- Change brush size

### Seam placement logic

If there is a seam enforcer, it always places seams into the enforcer area.

If there is a blocker, its area is excluded from possible seam candidates.

The Nearest, Rear and Random [Seam position](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-position_151069) options are still respected. When the Aligned option is active and enforcers are used, the seam is placed **in the middle of the enforcer area**. This allows drawing smooth seams over the model.

If a layer has multiple seam enforcers - **WILL BE UPDATED SOON**

### Cursor type

#### Spherical cursor (default)

Paints everything inside the sphere regardless of whether it is visible or not from the current view. The preferred method for most cases.

#### Circular cursor

Paints all visible places inside the circle from the current view, possibly leaving unpainted areas, but never painting behind corners.

### Clipping plane

You can use the clipping plane tool to hide a part of the object, so that difficult to reach areas can be easily painted. Move the slider from left to right to move the clipping plane.

The **Reset direction** button will align the clipping plane tool parallel to the current camera view. E.g. if you want to have the clipping plane moving up-down, look at the model from the top ( **Top view** 1 ) and hit the Reset direction button. The button appears when you move the slider to any non-zero value.

# [4. Z-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-z-axis-assembly_168629)

-  **Besides the X-axis, please prepare for the following step:**

- Smooth rod 320 mm (2x)

**WARNING:**

be very careful while installing the X-axis on the trapezoidal lead screws. The process should be smooth,

**otherwise you might damage the thread**

inside the plastic nut. Reseat the axis if necessary.

- Carefully slide the X-axis on the trapezoidal lead screws. By rotating both screws simultaneously let the X-axis slide until both trapezoidal lead screws are visible. If you feel any significant resistance, try to reseat the axis first.

- Make sure the top smooth rod of the X-axis and the lower edge of the frame are parallel.

-  **NOW, PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL!** Gently insert **the remaining smooth rods** through the bearings on the X-axis all the way down into printed parts, do not apply too much force and do not tilt the rod!

In case you manage to push out balls from the bearings, please count them. One or two balls are ok, if there are more of them, please consider ordering new bearings

# [5. E-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_169235)

In this step, we will finish tensioning the belt. Please read the instructions first, your belt might have proper tension already, then there is no need for additional screw adjustment.

- First, slightly release all the screws holding the motor, otherwise, the "tensioner" won't work (the motor must be able to move).

- Using ball-end Allen key start tightening the screw on the rear side of the X-end-motor, but after each turn or two check the tension in the belt.

- For the optimal performance, the belt must be a bit harder to press with your fingers. Move the extruder all the way to the X-end-idler and try the belt tension in the middle of the X-axis.

- When you achieve optimal tension, please tighten the screws again.

In case you experience X-axis failure during calibration or skipped layers in the X direction, you can adjust this screw accordingly. Tightening the screw stretches the belt. Releasing the screw has opposite effect. Each time don't forget to release the screws on the motor first.

# [QR Error codes](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/qr-error-codes_176114)

This is an advanced system for displaying error screens providing more useful information to the user. In case of an issue, the printer will display the name of the error followed by a brief description and a QR code. Take your phone, scan the code, and get immediately redirected to an article, which will in detail explain, what happened to your printer and how to fix the problem.

_QR error screen for MINI on the left and for SL1 on the right._

Error codes are supported at the following printers:

* Original Prusa MINI & MINI+ _(starting firmware 4.3.0)_
* Original Prusa SL1 _(starting firmware 1.5.0)_



### How to use the error code

In case your printer displays the error screen, there are multiple ways, how to access the article:

* Scan the QR code from the printer screen using a phone or tablet
* Use the link displayed on the screen (e.g. help.prusa3d.com/en/12201)
* Open help.prusa3d.com and search for the error (e.g. 12201)



Follow the article explaining what went wrong and how to fix the issue. Note that some errors might require you to replace the broken part(s) of the printer. If a replacement is necessary, there will be a link to the service guide at the bottom of the article.

### Error code explained

How is each code created? Let's use error #12201 again as an example. The code consists of five numbers with the following pattern: XXYZZ

**# XXYZZ** **[Heating failed bed #12201 (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/preheat-error-bed-12201-mini_112444)**

XX - ID number of the printer, according to USB PID

ZZ - ID number for the specific error

12 - Printer number 12: Original Prusa MINI

2 - Error category: Temperature error

01 - Specific error code: Heatbed heating failed

More information about the types of printers, categories, and a full list of the error codes can be found in the following

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Error-Codes)

.

### URL format

The URL link embedded in the QR code may contain an optional “device hash”. This can be disabled in the MINI+ in _Settings_ , and in the SL1 in _Settings- >Settings and Sensors_. Including this information enables us to check, whether you are running the latest version of firmware and if not, we will inform you at the top of the article. The information provided in the URL is stored in our database to help us better understand, which errors are the most common and how many errors each printer experienced.

Example of the URL in the QR code: https://help.prusa3d.com/en/12201/OI6HB7H6/410

* en -> a language of the landing page with the article
* 12201 -> the unique error code sequence
* OI6HB7H6 -> device hash
* 410 -> firmware version in your 3D printer



_An example of the error page with the printer running outdated firmware_

### Device hash

The device hash cannot be used to recover anything sensitive like a serial number and isn’t used for anything else than the QR codes feature therefore there are absolutely no security concerns. This feature is turned ON by default. In case you don't want to use this enhanced feature, you can switch it off in the printer's menu by setting the “Device hash in QR” to OFF.

Once you turn it off, the QR code URL will contain only the following: https://help.prusa3d.com/en/12201/

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_176529)

- 3D printed parts are very precise, however, there still might be a tolerance in the printed part and same goes for the size of the nut.

- Therefore it might happen, that the nut won't fit easily in or might be falling out. Let's see, how to fix it:

-  **Nut won't fit in** : use a screw with a thread along its entire length (typically: M3x10, M3x18) and screw it from the opposite side of the opening. While tightening the screw, the nut will be pulled in. Remove the screw afterwards.

-  **Nut keeps falling out** : Use a piece of tape to fix the nut temporarily in place, as soon as you insert the screw in, you can remove the tape. _Using glue isn't recommended as it can partly reach into the thread and you won't be able to tighten the screw properly._

- Every time we recommend to use the "screw pulling technique", you will be reminded with Joe's avatar ;)

# [Tilt endstop not reached #10115 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tilt-endstop-not-reached-10115-sl1-sl1s_176637)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **Failed to reach tilt endstop, please check that the cable is connected and repeat the action**.

Error name: Tilt endstop not reached

Issued when the printer did not manage to move the connecting rod as it should.

### How to fix it?

The inability to home the tilt might indicate that there is a physical block of the tilt mechanism or an assembly error in the motor and the connecting rod.

1. Open the eight M3x5b screws securing the cover. **Be careful to unplug the USB & Power-cable before removing the cover completely.**


2. Remove the M4x10 screw holding the right side of the touch screen. It is not necessary to remove the left screw. Just loosen it about a half-turn and you can slide the screen out, like a door. This will give you access to the motor and connecting rod.



Be very careful with the touch screen flat cable. It is fragile and can be easily damaged or cut.

3. Move the connecting rod with your hands and see if it has a full range of motion and if the blade sensor-trigger is between the two sides of the sensor. If so, jump to step 12. If any resistance is found, continue with the next step.


4. Remove the M3nN-nut from the screw that connects the tilt-mechanism and the connecting rod. You can do that by using a spanner or pliers to hold the nut and an Allen key to unscrew from the other side.


5. Remove the two M4x8 screws securing the tilt-motor holder to the bottom plate.


6. Remove the motor-holder and the connecting-rod from the tilt mechanism.
7. Go to [Step 18](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544#9384) of [2\. Base & Tower](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544) of the assembly guide, and remake the connection of the connecting rod and the motor shaft.



Pay extra attention to this step, as not aligning the connecting rod with the protrusion on the holder as instructed will cause the issue again.

8. Reassemble first the tilt to the connecting rod, make sure that after tightening the nut the two parts are in contact.



Do not over-tighten the nut!

9. Connect the motor holder to the bottom plate using the M4x8 screws.


10. Make sure that the optical sensor cable has its correct end connected to the sensor. The middle wire should be blue. In case the middle wire on the sensor connector is black, the connection will need to be swapped.
11. Move the connecting-rod manually and see if it moves smoothly until the blade sensor-trigger is between the two sides of the sensor.



Make sure the sensor is secured!

12. Slide the LCD back to its place, and tighten both M4x10 screws holding it.


13. Connect the USB and Power cable and close the eight M3x5b screws that hold the cover. Tighten them diagonally at first, and add all the screws before tightening them. Pay attention to the cables from the electronics so that they are not pinched.


14. Run the wizard again.

# [Tower check failed #10118 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tower-check-failed-10118-sl1-sl1s_177080)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **Tower axis check failed! Please check if the ball-screw can move smoothly in its entire range**.

Error name: Tower check failed

Issued when the SL1 is not able to measure the axial length of the tower axis.

### How to fix it?

Check if anything is blocking the axis movement. If you cannot see anything blocking the axis movement, please contact [Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287).

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **Display test failed, check the connection between the display and the A64** **board**.

Error name: Display test failed

Issued when the printer was not able to test the print display.

### How to fix it?

Check the cable connection to the mainboard. Be careful as the print display flat cable is very fragile.

# [Tower position error #10123 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tower-position-error-10123-sl1-sl1s_177122)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **Tower not in the expected position. Are the platform and tank mounted and secured correctly?**

Error name: Tower position error

Issued when the calibration has not been able to successfully calibrate the tower axis.

### How to fix it?

This error happens when the printer detects the tower as being at a level that, when fully lowered, will be lower the display. This can happen if the tower calibration has not been made correctly, or if there are any loose parts in the tower axis or on the tank.

To fix the error, remake the printer calibration (LCD Menu -> Settings -> Calibration). The cantilever screw needs to be very firmly tightened. When tightening one or both of the cantilever screws, do so with the short part of the Allen key, as you can apply more force this way.

If the issue persists, please contact [Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287).

# [Infill patterns](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill-patterns_177130)

PrusaSlicer offers many infill patterns to choose from. When choosing an infill pattern, these are the main things to consider:

* Print speed
* Density per material used (better support for top layers with less material)
* Visuals
* Support for top layers
* Flexibility (for TPU/TPE prints)



Different infill patterns are used for some, but usually not all applications:

* low-density filling of the inside of a model
* filling the top layers
* filling the bottom layers
* generating support material



### Infill types and their properties

#### Gyroid infill

The Gyroid is our favorite and one of the best infills. It’s one of the few 3D structures that provide great support in every direction. Plus it’s printed relatively fast, saves material, doesn’t cross itself at one layer and looks great. The special shape of this infill allows filling it with resin or another liquid.

* It's 3 dimensional - giving it **equal strength in all directions**
* It can be printed fairly **quickly**
* It **doesn't cross itself** in the same layer
* It has a **good strength/weight ratio**
* It allows **filling it with resin** or another liquid.
* (We think) it **looks really neat**



#### Cubic

This is an infill with paths that cross each other within one layer. It creates cubes oriented with one corner facing down. This way it makes numerous air pockets that might serve as heat insulation, or cause the object to float on water (with waterproof filaments such as PETG). Print time and filament consumption does not differ from the previous infills.

#### Adaptive cubic infill

The Adaptive cubic infill works on the same principle as cubic. It consists of cubes oriented corner-down where lines cross themselves in one layer. Unlike simple cubic infill, this infill gets automatically more or less dense, depending on the distance to the nearest wall, leaving large cavities in the middle. This is especially useful for large prints with a big internal volume. The print will have denser infill at the top, bottom and around all sides, but it will have lower density near the center of the volume. The result is **shorter print time** and **lower filament consumption** while maintaining great support for top layers and similar mechanical properties. Material consumption is approx. 1/4 less than the rectilinear infill.

The Adaptive Cubic infill works by refining those cells of an [octree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree), that contain any object triangle. Anchors are added to each infill line. This makes the infill sturdier and it stabilizes the extrusion flow at the start of an infill line.

#### Support cubic infill

This infill gets automatically denser depending on the distance to the nearest top layer (the infill density increases only in the Z-axis). Its primary function is to support top layers by saving as much material as possible, it doesn’t improve any mechanical qualities of the model. **Material consumption and print time of this infill are by far the lowest of all the supported infills**.

#### Rectilinear

Rectilinear is one of the basic infill patterns. It creates a rectilinear grid by printing one layer in one direction, the next layer rotated by 90°, etc. This way, it saves filament and doesn’t accumulate material at crossings (unlike grid). It’s one of the fastest printed infills.

Compared to the **Grid** pattern, Rectilinear has double the support for top layers using the same amount of material.

This type of infill is the only one recommended for 100% infill printing. If you have another type of infill set in your profile and change the infill percentage to 100% density, PrusaSlicer will automatically change the infill type to rectilinear.

#### Aligned rectilinear

This infill is formed by parallel lines drawn inside the model, which resemble the outside support structures. Similar to the previous type, this infill saves time, has average material consumption, plus it doesn’t accumulate material at crossings. However, using this infill might cause some trouble when the direction of the lines in the infill is the same as in the infill of the first top solid layer – if they are perfectly parallel, the top layers might have issues with bridging.

#### Grid

This is one of the simplest and fastest variants of infill. Unlike rectilinear, it’s printed in both directions (rotated by 90°) in each layer. This way, material accumulates in spots where the paths cross. The grid infill is more solid (and has better layer adhesion) than the rectilinear infill, however, it sometimes can cause annoying noise or even a print failure due to the nozzle going over the crossings where material accumulates.

Due to the way this infill is printed, the paths cross and cause the material to accumulate in these spots. You may hear a specific noise as the nozzle hits these parts. This may even lead to a failed print.

#### Triangles

This infill works similarly to the grid infill – the paths cross in one layer, however, this time they are printed in three directions and form a triangle structure. Material and time consumption is almost identical to the grid.

#### Stars

The Stars infill is based on triangles but paths are shifted to make six-pointed stars. Again, this infill is created by lines that cross each other within a single layer. Material and time consumption is similar to the previous infill.

#### Line

The Line is one of the infills that don’t feature any crossing paths in one layer. Its paths are similar to the rectilinear infill but they are not parallel to each other. Instead, they are printed at an acute angle. Unsurprisingly, this infill is similar to rectilinear when it comes to printing time and material consumption.

#### Concentric

The concentric infill traces the model perimeter lines and makes them smaller towards the center. In other words: if you print a cylinder, the concentric infill will create concentric circles inside that cylinder. This can be useful with transparent parts or flexible models (RC tires for example). The main disadvantage is the time spent printing. Material consumption is not higher than previous types of infill patterns.

#### Honeycomb

This infill prints a grid made of hexagons. Its main advantage is mechanical resistance and optimal paths without crossings. The main disadvantages are higher material consumption (approx. 25% more) compared to other infills, and print time that can take up to twice the time of previously described options.

#### 3D honeycomb

3D honeycomb prints bigger and smaller squares and octagons to create columns of periodically increasing and decreasing thickness. Again, this infill doesn’t have crossing lines in one layer, however, due to the way it lays down the paths, it creates small gaps between layers. Material consumption and print time are slightly worse compared to the regular honeycomb pattern.

#### Hilbert curve

The Hilbert curve creates a rectangular labyrinth inside the model. The main advantage of this infill is its non-traditional look, plus it can be pretty easily filled with epoxy resin or another liquid – the model is split into several large cavities, instead of a number of small “bubbles”. The main disadvantage of this infill is increased print time, which sits somewhere between honeycomb and rectilinear infills. The material consumption of the Hilbert curve is similar to the rectilinear.

#### Archimedean chords

Again, this spiral-twisted infill allows easier filling with liquid. This simple shape saves material and time (compared to the rectilinear infill). Similar to the concentric infill, the Archimedean chords help with model flexibility if you print it with flexible filament.

#### Octagram spiral

Octagram spiral allows filling the object with liquid easily due to larger compartments made with this type of infill. An Octagram spiral might also help with flexibility for certain models. But mostly it’s for aesthetic purposes and top layer support. Material consumption is similar to Archimedean chords but print time is slightly longer.

#### Lightning

The lightning infill generates a branching structure that gets progressively denser towards the top surfaces to support them reliably. It saves even more material compared to the Support cubic infill. The lightning infill is based on paper  and ported from Cura, our thanks go to the Cura team for keeping it open-source.

### Types of top (bottom) layer infill

Editing infill doesn’t end with choosing an infill type for the internal parts of the object. You can also change top and bottom layer infill types to get some interesting results. These can be adjusted in the Print settings - Infill -Top (Bottom) fill pattern tab.

All seven types of top (bottom) infills printed **with 80% flow to highlight the patterns**.

#### Rectilinear

Again, this is one of the most common (and basic) types of top infill. The print paths are oriented zig-zag for the whole layer. However, this is the simplest type of infill that doesn’t provide any advantage whatsoever (see Monotonic infill).

#### Monotonic infill

The "monotonic" infill is essentially a rectilinear infill with modified path planning. The infill lines are extruded left to right monotonically, a line is never extruded to the left of an already extruded infill line. This strikingly simple strategy leads to a **homogenous** texture without ugly ridges. Ridges are often created when the left-to-right extrusions meet with right-to-left extrusions in the center of an infill area, while printing left to right only leads to a homogenous shine.

The seemingly simple left-to-right strategy is surprisingly difficult to implement optimally. We have implemented a variant of the [Ant Colony System](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Ant_colony_optimization) as described by [Raad Salman](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/research/research-groups/optimization/OptimizationMasterTheses/MScThesis-RaadSalman-final.pdf).

#### Aligned rectilinear

This infill pattern works similarly to the rectilinear infill but the last layers on all top surfaces are aligned in the same direction. This can help for creating a homogenous top layer pattern for models that have top layers in different heights (imagine a staircase model).

#### Concentric

The concentric infill pattern copies perimeter shapes. If you print a cylinder, it will create concentric circles on top of the model.

#### Hilbert curve

This is mostly an aesthetic infill. If it’s printed inside, Hilbert Curve creates rectangular shapes, while the topmost layer looks more like a wicker basket. Some people say that it looks “wormy”. This infill significantly increases the print time due to the complex shape.

#### Archimedean chords

The topmost layer of archimedean chords is printed in a spiral. This infill can save time when printing certain models.

#### Octagram spiral

Again, this infill is described above. It’s good mainly for aesthetic purposes but due to the complex shape, it prolongs the print time.

# [Can't copy project #10704 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cant-copy-project-10704-sl1-sl1s_177182)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **The internal memory is full, the project cannot be copied. You can continue printing - however, you must not remove the USB drive mid-print, otherwise, the process will fail.**

Error name: Can't copy project

### How to fix it?

Usually, once a model is loaded to the printer by a USB drive, you do not need to keep the USB connected to finish the print, as the SL1 will copy the model to its memory. When the **Printing directly** error message appears, it means that the printer cannot copy the file to its internal memory due to it being full. In order to print, you have two options:

* Printing directly from the USB drive, and not removing the USB from the SL1 during the whole print.
* Deleting some files from the printer. You can do that by going to the printer menu in the _LCD menu - > Print_ and swiping the file to the left. It will display the trash bin icon which can be tapped to delete a file.

# [Not enough resin #10706 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/not-enough-resin-10706-sl1-sl1s_177198)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **The amount of resin in the tank is not enough for the current project. Adding more resin will be required during the print.**

Error name: Not enough resin

### How to fix it?

When the SL1 shows this warning, starting the print is possible, but you may need to add more resin during the print. Note that stopping for a long time during the print may cause printing errors. It is recommended to fill the resin tank by the amount requested at the start of the print so the pause is not necessary.

---

# [Idler screw tension](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/idler-screw-tension_177367)

The Original Prusa FFF printers and upgrades use a screw(s) with a spring(s) to provide tension between the filament and the filament pulley. It is important to have this tension correct. If too loose the pulley will not be able to "grab" the filament, while if it is too tight the extruder motor can overexert itself and even start grinding the filament. With the exception of the MK2/S and MMU1, the correct tension remains the same across all of our printers.

When printing flexible filaments (TPU/TPE) you want the screw even looser than what is depicted here. Please see

[Flexible materials](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flexible-materials_2057)

for more information.

### MK2.5S/MK3S/MK3S+/MK3.5

**The idler screw should be about flush to protruding 0.5 -1 mm with the plastic part** when the filament is not loaded.

_Original Prusa MK3S_ _Original Prusa MK3S+_

### MMU2S unit

The MMU2S requires a slightly different extruder but also has 1 idler-screw on the left side of the extruder, like the picture above. Roughly the same tension should be applied but it should only be adjusted as a part of the [IR filament sensor calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-calibration-mmu2s_2245).

In addition to the screw on the extruder, the MMU2S unit itself has two tension screws on top (green arrows left picture), applying pressure to the filament upon load/unload. **These should be slightly below the surface of the plastic part (about 1 millimeter) when the filament is not loaded to the nozzle** (right picture **).**

### MMU3 unit

Both Idler tension screws should be adjusted so that the top of the screw head is flush or slightly above the top surface of the idler-body, as a default setting.

### MK3/MK2.5

This extruder design has two idler screws. **The head of the screw should be about flush to sticking out 1 - 1.5 mm when a filament is loaded.**

### MINI

The Original Prusa MINI has its idler screw on the bottom of the extruder, located on the Z-axis extrusion. This too should be about flush with the plastic, when the filament is not loaded.

### MK4/MK3.9/XL

The Original Prusa MK4 and the Original Prusa XL have two idler screws, that are inserted into the Idler Nut. The Idler Nut keeps the Idler, the part that includes the two driven gears, in place. **The tips of the screws must be aligned with the front surface of the Idler Nut**.

_Original Prusa MK4_ _Original Prusa XL_

### MK2S

The Original Prusa MK2S had a different extruder design. It has two screws, where the length of the springs **should be circa 13 mm when tightened**. After some use, it is ok to tighten them a little bit more, but the two screws must be equal.

# [Parameters out of range #10707 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/parameters-out-of-range-10707-sl1-sl1s_177382)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **The print parameters are out of range of the printer, the system can try to fix the project. Proceed?**

Error name: Parameters out of range

### How to fix it?

In case a printing parameter like the layer thickness or exposure time has been manually modified, either in a slicer or directly on the printer, the value for the parameter might be out of range. The printer will show this warning to either continue or cancel the print. In case you continue, the printer will automatically change the values to the closest valid ones. If you decide to cancel the print, re-slice the part in the [PrusaSlicer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/install-prusaslicer_1903), and make sure that you have the latest [firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-sl1-sl1s_124776).

# [Not connected to network #10402 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/not-connected-to-network-10402-sl1-sl1s_177410)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **The printer is not connected to the internet, please check the connection in the Settings.**

Error name: Not connected to network

### How to fix it?

There are two ways to connect the SL1 to the internet. You can use a standard RJ-45 ethernet cable. Connect it to your router, and the printer should obtain an IP address automatically - however, this depends on your network configuration. Since every network is different, please refer to your router’s instructions or your provider’s tech support in case you run into trouble. To check whether the connection has been successfully created, go to Main Menu - Settings - Network.

It is also possible to use the built-in Wi-fi network card compatible with 2.4GHz networks. To open the Wi-Fi network browser, go to Settings - Network. A list of all available networks will be displayed. Select your Wi-Fi network and connect to it by typing your password using the on-screen touch keyboard. You can connect a USB keyboard to the front USB port in case the on-screen keyboard is too small.

Since every network is different, we cannot provide exact instructions on how to connect to your wireless/wired network. If you encounter any trouble, please refer to your router’s manual, or contact your internet provider’s tech support. The quality of your wireless connection depends on many factors - such as the type/configuration of the router, the distance of the printer from the router, or wireless (EMI) interference in your area.

# [Ironing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ironing_177488)

This tool is available from **PrusaSlicer version 2.3.**

This option is not available when PrusaSlicer is in

[Simple mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

.

### What is Ironing and how does it work?

Ironing smooths flat top surfaces by running a special second infill phase **at the same layer**.

As the hot nozzle travels over the just printed top layer, it flattens any plastic that might have curled up. The nozzle also **extrudes a small amount of filament** to fill in any holes in the top surface. The spacing between individual ironing passes is usually a fraction of the nozzle diameter. That means the nozzle will go over the same spot several times. Ironing is angled at a fixed 45 degrees compared to the first phase of normal top infill as this approach produces better results.

Ironing OFF (left), Ironing ON (right) Macro comparison of Ironing OFF (left), Ironing ON (right)

### Downsides

The main downside is **increased print time** as the second phase of the top infill is performed with very small spacing between ironing lines. You can see how much print time will be spent on ironing in the preview.

If you're ironing a big surface area, on some machines you might experience **heat creep** and eventually, a clogged hotend because the extrusion is very small and slow during ironing. This might be a problem mainly when printing with PLA, because of its low-temperature resistance. The risk is increased during summer heatwaves.

Another downside is that the edges will be a tiny bit fuzzy or less sharp. The ironing toolpath is planned for a small extrusion, but the nozzle is physically still the same size, so some plastic will bleed over the edge.

### When to use ironing

Ironing is useful for prints with flat top surfaces, like **nameplates, logos, badges, boxes, lids** , etc.

Ironing can also be useful when you want to glue two pieces together and need the surfaces to be as flat as possible so that the gap between them is minimized.

**Ironing is not useful for round objects, figures, and organic shapes** in general. It's also not useful for objects that do have flat areas, but these flat areas are not aligned parallel to the print bed. With that said, ironing will not have a significant negative impact when printing such models, it will just unnecessarily increase the print time.

Ironing has little to no effect on non-flat surfaces, Ironing Off (left), Ironing On (right)

Some models can be printed upside down. The bottom layer printed on the build plate will typically be even smoother than an ironed top layer. And you can imprint a texture into the print, depending on the print sheet that you use.

**Monotonic infill**

is another feature, which improves the quality of top layers. Use it in combination with Ironing to get the best results. Original Prusa profiles have Monotonic infill already set as the default top layer pattern.

### How to turn Ironing on for all models

Ironing is not available in the Simple mode, so switch to the Advanced or Expert mode.
Then select **Print settings - Infill - Ironing - Enable Ironing**.

### How to turn Ironing on just for the selected model

First, switch to the Expert mode, ironing for individual models is only enabled in this mode. Right-click on a model and select **Add settings - Ironing** from the context menu. Tick **Enable ironing** , optionally you can also select the rest of the ironing settings in order to customize them on a model-per-model basis. You can now change the ironing settings for this model using the right panel.

If you have several [Instances](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/copy-paste-instances_1769) of the same object on the build plate and you want to turn on Ironing just for one of them, you first have to right-click the model and pick _Set as a separate object_ from the context menu. Otherwise, you'd turn it on for all instances, as they share all settings.

### Modifiers - How to turn Ironing on just for selected surfaces

You can use [Height range modifiers](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/modifiers_1767#height-range-modifier) or [Modifier meshes](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/modifiers_1767#modifier-meshes) to turn on Ironing just for a part of a model (in the Expert mode).

#### Height range modifier

Because ironing works only on flat areas, it makes sense to use a height range modifier to specify a vertical interval, where ironing will be used.

1. Right-click a model and select **Height range modifier**.
2. Specify the Start height and Stop height in the right panel
3. Right-click the cogwheel next to the height range modifier in the right panel
4. Select **Add settings - Ironing**
5. Tick Enable ironing, you can now toggle ironing on just for this part in the right panel



#### Modifier mesh

1. Right-click a model and select Add modifier
2. You can either use a basic shape (box, cylinder) or use **Load...** to import custom mesh as a modifier
3. Position the modifier to overlap your desired part of a model
4. Right-click the cogwheel next to the modifier in the right panel
5. Select **Add settings - Ironing**
6. Tick Enable ironing, you can now toggle ironing on just for this part in the right panel



### Ironing type

#### All top surfaces

The nozzle will iron the top layer of each surface (the last layer of each flat area).

#### Topmost surface only

Only the very last layer of the object will be ironed. This means that in the case of an embossed text (oriented parallel to the print bed), only the top of the letters will be ironed, but not the space between the letters.

All top surfaces (left), Topmost surface only (right)

### All solid surfaces

This option is not working properly at the moment.

Every layer will get an ironing pass. An experimental feature meant to be used with 100% infill to create clearer transparent objects.

### Flow rate

Percent of flow rate relative to the object's normal layer height.

### Spacing between ironing passes

Distance between individual ironing lines. This value should be smaller than your nozzle diameter. Because of this, the nozzle will pass over the same spot several times.

### Speed

This option is not grouped with the other Ironing settings. Instead, you'll find it in Print settings - Speed - Ironing. Feel free to experiment with this value, but generally, slower speeds work the best.

### Calibration

Ironing is very sensitive to accurate extruder calibration. Too little and shiny groves will be visible at the top layer, which will not be ironed. Too much and the excess plastic will be dragged by the nozzle to the edges of the top surface. So calibrating is a matter of trial and error. One may experiment with the ironing flow, speed, and spacing to achieve the best results.

### Different materials

As far as settings go, they don't really differentiate between various materials. However, ironing does perform slightly differently depending on the filament used.

PLA irons very nicely, however, it is most prone to heat creep (depending on your printer and ambient temperature).

PETG irons fine, but there's an increased risk of extra filament sticking to the nozzle. This plastic might accumulate on the nozzle, get dark as it's overheated, and eventually attach to the print. The same goes for FLEX, but much more pronounced.

ASA irons incredibly well, producing super smooth top surfaces.

When we tried ironing WOOD FILLED filaments, we didn't achieve very good results. But your experience may vary.

#### History

The Ironing idea was first proposed by the user "Neotko" on the Ultimaker community forum. Neotko prototyped "Neosanding" - a smoothing of top surfaces in Simplify3D by running a second infill phase at the same print height with zero or a tiny extrusion rate perpendicularly to the first infill run. The "Neosanding" was later integrated by Ultimaker into their Cura slicer. Kisslicer integrated Ironing with a small twist: The second phase is not perpendicular to the first phase, but at 45 degrees, which Jonathan, the author of Kisslicer validated to produce better results. PrusaSlicer implements Neotko's "Neosanding" at 45 degrees as in Kisslicer.

_You can see the ironing pass on the right cube_

# [Factory reset (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mini_177516)

Stored separately from the firmware itself, in the mainboard's EEPROM, you have statistics of your printer, calibration data related to the movement of the printer, and PID values for heating. If these values become corrupted or are not compatible with a new version of the firmware, you can have some issues. If so, we recommend doing a factory reset to clear these values.

Doing a factory reset will clear statistics data, like total printing time and filament use.

### How to

On the Original Prusa MINI the Factory reset can be performed from the _LCD menu - > Settings -> Factory reset._

### Flashing the firmware

If you are seeing any inconsistent behavior we recommend also flashing the firmware. A factory reset followed by flashing the firmware and recalibrating will resolve most firmware issues you may encounter.

# [Factory reset (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-sl1-sl1s_177524)

Stored separately from the firmware itself, you have calibration data related to the operation of the printer and various statistics. If these values become corrupted or are not compatible with a new version of the firmware, you can have some issues. If so, we recommend doing a factory reset.

Doing a factory reset will clear statistics data, like total printing time and material use.

There have been some changes to the menu structure of the SL1 between firmware versions. Therefore we will outline how to do the procedure starting with the latest version.

### Procedure FW 1.5.0 and above

The Factory reset can be performed from the _LCD menu - > Settings -> Firmware -> Factory reset._

### Procedure FW 1.4.2 and below

The Factory reset can be performed from the _LCD menu - > Settings -> Advanced Settings -> Factory reset._

### Upgrading the firmware

If you are seeing any inconsistent behavior we recommend also updating the firmware. A factory reset followed by flashing the firmware and recalibrating will resolve most firmware issues you may encounter.

# [Packing Multi Material upgrade for return](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/packing-multi-material-upgrade-for-return_177555)

Do you need to send your Multi Material upgrade back for a refund or repair? Unlike in the case of a return shipment of a single part, when returning an assembled Multi-material upgrade we would like you to follow some guidelines to prevent any damage during the transport.

In order to send any product back to us, please do so after an agreement with our Customer Support. Contact us on email

**[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**

or live chat where we are available 24/7.

### Return for refund

If you are returning the MMU2S for a refund, **you must include everything that came with the MMU2S** Upgrade Kit. This includes:

* Power cable, signal cable, USB cable
* All PTFE tubes
* Spool Holders (base, bearings, shafts, and endstops)
* Filament buffer
* Pliers, screwdriver, Allen keys



If we have sent you some replacement parts before, don't forget to **send us back the original (broken) parts** too.

### Return for repair

Since the MMU2S relies on an Original Prusa MK3S/MK2.5S for its operation, **the MMU2S can only be sent to repair accompanied by the printer.** Since we can not guarantee a working system without the printer, any standalone MMU2S we receive will be returned without inspection or repair.

In the package **for repair, you do not have to include everything**. You can keep the tools (pliers, screwdriver, Allen key), as well as the cables, buffer, and the spool holder, but **please include the flexible magnetic steel sheet** (if you have more sheets, always include **the one that you are using when the problem happens** ).

We also need you to **send us a 1 m sample of each filament** that was giving you a hard time, and **the SD card with the G-code** that you had trouble printing. Please include a copy of the **original STL file** too.

### List of packaging material

#### Cardboard box

For packing the printer, follow the procedure outlined in [Packing i3 printer for return](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/packing-i3-printer-for-return_2278#how-to-pack-the-printer). The MMU2S is packed in the printer's box, so please see this guide to the end before sealing up the box.

For the MMU you need an additional box. You can use the accessories box that comes with the printer, or if you do not have it, use a box at least 23 x 21 x 10 cm / 9 x 8 x 4 in.

#### Packaging material

The MMU needs to be packed in a way that it is secured, and does not move inside the box. For that, you can use bubble wrap, crumpled-up paper, old newspaper, or ads. **Do not use foam peanuts or shredded paper.
**

### How to pack the Multi Material upgrade

**Before you start packing it down, get out your phone or camera to take pictures of the printer before and during the packing process.**

1. Remove the MMU signal cable (left picture) and the MMU power cable (right picture) from the Einsy Rambo. _Re-tighten the terminal screws on the Einsy Rambo after removing the MMU power cables._


2. Remove the MMU unit from the printer's frame by tilting it forward (purple arrows), releasing the latch below (green arrow).
3. Unscrew and remove the MMU2S frame holder, and separate it into a bag (blue arrows right picture).


2. Take the box you will place the MMU unit in, and cut a hole for the PTFE tubes on the left side of the box (left picture).
3. Line the box with packing material that will protect the parts from damage, and wrap the MMU in the packing material as well. Make sure that the PTFE tubes are free for the next step.
4. Push the PTFE tubes through the side that was cut from the box in step 3 (right side picture).


7. Add packing material on the sides of the MMU unit so it does not move around the box during transport.
8. Add the bag with the frame holders on top of the packing material (left side picture). **Fill all empty space!**
9. Close the box and secure it with tape (right side picture).


10. Place the packed MMU2S in a corner of the printer's box, after the printer is placed in the box (left picture). Isolate it from the printer by packing material (right picture). If you are using the box that came with the pre-assembled printer, there is a space for it where the accessories were located.


11. Head back to the article [Packing i3 printer for return](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/packing-i3-printer-for-return_2278#how-to-pack-the-printer) to finish up the packing of the printer.



**A printer damaged during transport back to us may not be eligible for a full refund.**

**If you send us your kit for repair partially (or fully) disassembled, you will be asked to pay the price difference between the kit and the assembled printer.**

Moreover, it can double the time needed to settle your claim.

# [Building your MINI+](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/building-your-mini_177717)

- Before covering the electronics, make sure the square nut is correctly positioned in the printed part. **The nut must not fall out!** This can cause fatal damage to the electronics.

- Insert the cover back in, make sure it is properly seated in the slot.

-  **Place the second cover on the top and arrange the cables:**

-  **Extruder bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially in. Also, it must be tilted away from the printer.

-  **Heatbed bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially inside the box.

-  **Filament sensor cable** (optional), ensure that the textile sleeve wrapped around the cables is partially inside the box.

- Now, tighten the second cover. Check that no cable is pinched.

# [Blown Fuse (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mini_179613)

The Original Prusa MINI is equipped with a 24V Buddy mainboard. This 32-bit logic board has two removable **automotive fuses** protecting the crucial components. If your printer or some of its components suddenly stopped working, it is recommended to check these fuses and replace them if necessary.

**Each fuse protects a different part of the board:**

* **F1 (3A fuse) -** Stepper drivers (motors) and logic.
* **F2 (7.5A fuse) -** Heatbed heater and hotend heater.



### Checking the Buddy fuses

1. **Turn the printer off** and **disconnect the power cord.**
2. Open the electronics cover by removing the M3 screw holding the cover door closed. You may refer to [Step 10 of the assembly manual](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/building-your-mini_6384#6640) for more details.
3. Now you have access to the Buddy board. **Pull the fuses out** and inspect them. The photos below show what intact fuses look like. Inspect them from this angle and see if the little wire inside is not broken.



If you own a multimeter, you can check the components for a potential short.

[Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117)

will show you how.

### Replacing blown fuses

If you find out that any of the fuses are blown, you can easily replace them. The fuses we use are known as **ATO blade fuses** for automotive applications and can be found at any local **car parts** /hardware store or ordered online. _It's a good practice to bring the blown fuse with you so that you can get the exact same one._

1. **Turn the printer off, disconnect the power** and remove the blown fuse(s) from their sockets.
2. Place the new fuse in the correct slot - **Double check that you are replacing 3A for 3A or 7.5A for 7.5A.**
3. **Unplug any components** connected to the previously blown fuse and try to turn on your printer. Check for any kind of unwanted behavior.
4. Once again, **turn off the printer and remove the power cord.** Then **reconnect all the disconnected components**.

# [How to replace SuperPINDA (MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-superpinda-mk3s-mk3s_179920)

- Open one end of the textile sleeve and slide it on the cable bundle leading from the extruder.

- Leave the cables from the hotend out for now.

- Length of the first wrap should be slightly longer than the cable-holder part, about 5 cm is enough.

- Gently twist the sleeve to make it smaller and tighter around the cables, orient the sleeve's seam downwards, then slide the sleeve towards the extruder.

-  **Take 3 zip ties** and insert them into the **lower row** of holes on the cable-holder.

- Twist the sleeve again (without twisting the cables inside) and tighten the zip ties.

**IMPORTANT**

: Cut the remaining part of each zip tie using pliers as closest to its head as possible. Note the correct position of each zip ties's head (slightly off-centre to the left).

# [Resin too high #10109 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/resin-too-high-10109-sl1-sl1s_179981)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **Measured resin volume [amount] ml is higher than required for this print. Make sure that the resin level does not exceed the 100% mark and restart the print.**

Error name: Resin too high

Issued when the resin level is too high and needs some resin needs to be removed before the print.

### How to fix it?

If the print starts, the tank movements might spill the resin to the parts below. Pour some of the resin back into the bottle through a filter until you have just the amount of resin required for the print.

If the resin spills from the tank please clean as much as possible with a paper towel and contact our [Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287).

# [2B. MK3S Extruder disassembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2b-mk3s-extruder-disassembly_181561)

- Open the upgrade package and look for a bag with the new (shorter) PTFE tubes

- Check the new PTFE tube. Make sure both ends are clean.

- Now it is time to insert the new PTFE tube. Note there are two different ends:

- One end of the tube has a **"rounded"** outer edge. This end must be **inside the hotend**.

- Look at the other end, where the tube is drilled inside, the shape of the **edge is "conical"**. This is the side, where filament enters the tube. This part must be outside the hotend.

- Push the black collet in. Slide the tube all the way in and hold it!

- Using second hand pull the collet out and only then release the tube!!! **THIS IS CRUCIAL** for the hotend to work properly. **The tube must not be able to move in or out!**

# [3A. MK3 Extruder upgrade](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3a-mk3-extruder-upgrade_182789)

In this step, we will finish tensioning the belt. Please read the instructions first, your belt might have proper tension already, then there is no need for additional screw adjustment.

- First, slightly release all the screws holding the motor, otherwise, the "tensioner" won't work (the motor must be able to move).

**ATTENTION !!! BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHILE TIGHTENING, YOU CAN CRACK THE PART IF YOU OVER TIGHT THE SCREW.**

- Using Allen key start tightening the M3x18 screw inside the X-end-motor, but after each turn or two check the tension in the belt.

- For the optimal performance, the belt must be a bit harder to press with your fingers. Move the extruder all the way to the X-end-idler and try the belt tension in the middle of the X-axis.

- When you achieve optimal tension, please tighten the screws again.

In case you experience X-axis failure during calibration or skipped layers in the X direction, you can adjust this screw accordingly. Tightening the screw stretches the belt. Releasing the screw has opposite effect. Each time don't forget to release the screws on the motor first.

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_186036)

- 3D printed parts are very precise, however, there still might be a tolerance in the printed part and same goes for the size of the nut.

- Therefore it might happen, that the nut won't fit easily in or might be falling out. Let's see, how to fix it:

-  **Nut won't fit in** : use a screw with a thread along its entire length (typically: M3x10, M3x18) and screw it from the opposite side of the opening. While tightening the screw, the nut will be pulled in. Remove the screw afterwards.

- Nut keeps falling out: Use a piece of tape to fix the nut temporarily in place, as soon as you insert the screw in, you can remove the tape. _Using glue isn't recommended as it can partly reach into the thread and you won't be able to tighten the screw properly._

- Every time we recommend using the "screw pulling technique", you will be reminded with Joe's avatar ;)

Parts in the pictures are used as an example.

# [3B. MK3S Extruder upgrade](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3b-mk3s-extruder-upgrade_186842)

- Guide the extruder motor cable like in the picture. Leave some slack on the cable below the extruder motor. Leave a slack of about 2-3 cm (0.8 - 1.2 inch) below the extruder motor. _This comes in handy for easier disassembly in the future._

- Then guide the cable in the "channel" all the way to the back.

**The fan has two sides,**

one has a sticker. Make sure, this side is facing inside the extruder.

- First, create a loop on the cable. Make sure the black protective wrap is close to the edge of the fan. See the picture.

- Place the fan on the extruder and proceed in the following manner:

- Start by placing the fan's cable in the upper channel

- Slide the fan close to the X-carriage and **GENTLY PUSH** the cable in using an Allen key. Before you push the fan all the way to the left, place the cable in the X-carriage channel.

# [2A. MK3S+ extruder disassembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2a-mk3s-extruder-disassembly_188397)

- Release the M3x10 screw and remove it.

- Remove the FS-cover it will be replaced with a new one.

- Release the screw holding the idler, you can leave it in the extruder.

- Release the M2x8 screw, carefully unplug and remove the IR filament sensor. **Keep it safe, you will need the sensor for the reassembly.**

**Be careful**

with the filament sensor, do not touch the components on the PCB. Hold the PCB by its sides.

- Release both M3x40 screws, just few turns to create about 0.5cm (0.2inch) gap in the extruder body.

- Release and remove all screws holding the Hotend fan. We need to reach a screw behind the fan.

# [3A. MK3S+ extruder upgrade](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3a-mk3s-extruder-upgrade_188808)

**Carefully and quietly**

open the bag with the Haribo sweets. High level of

**noise might attract nearby predators!**

- Sort the bears into six rows according to the following scheme (colours might differ):

-  **Previous and current chapter** were very difficult, at least **25 % of total amount is needed**.

-  **Idler assembly** is quite easy, **10 %** is enough.

-  **Pulley body assembly** requires your attention, eat no less than **20 %** of all bears.

-  **Electronics assembly** is the last chapter with high level of difficulty, consume **25 %**.

-  **Spool holders with the buffer** are easy to make, research shows that **10 %** is enough.

-  **Preflight check** is almost effortless. Experienced user will require no more than **10 %**.

# [PrusaSlicer G-code viewer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusaslicer-g-code-viewer_193152)

**Standalone PrusaSlicer G-code Viewer** is a lightweight application, which you can use to quickly preview G-codes from all popular slicers. Its behavior is identical to the preview in PrusaSlicer (the same code is used), however, you can load an external G-code file.

### Supported slicers

We currently parse, and up to some level interpret, G-code from:

* PrusaSlicer
* Slic3r and Slic3rPE
* CURA
* ideaMaker
* Simplify3D
* Craftware
* KISSSlicer



PrusaSlicer Standalone G-code Viewer tries hard to estimate the extrusion widths, layer heights, extrusion types, types of moves, layers, etc. from the G-code generated by various slicers. The G-code itself does not contain all the information mentioned above, thus the G-code is usually augmented with slicer specific comments. We try to get as much data as possible, but some parts might still get marked as unknown.

PrusaSlicer version 2.3 and newer augments the G-code with comments ";TYPE:", ";HEIGHT:", ";LAYER_CHANGE", ";COLOR_CHANGE", ";PAUSE_PRINT" and ";CUSTOM_GCODE". G-code generated by older PrusaSlicer which does not contain these new annotations will still be displayed, but the extrusion widths or extrusion types may not be shown reliably.

G-code generated with other slicers will most likely still load correctly, but some features, such as the print time analysis by feature might be unavailable.

### Associate with .gcode file extension

If you associate the .gcode file extension with the G-code viewer, you'll be able to launch it simply by opening the file (double-clicking on it or pressing Enter). You can do so by enabling **Configuration - Preferences - Associate .gcode files to PrusaSlicer G-code Viewer**.

Alternatively, you associate the file extension using your operating system tools.

#### Windows

1. Right-click any G-code file
2. Select **Open with - Choose default program...** \- **PrusaSlicer G-code Viewer**
3. Click **More** at the bottom
4. Tick **Always use this app**



#### macOS

1. Select any G-code file in the Finder and choose **File > Get Info**
2. In the Open With section, select **PrusaSlicer G-code Viewer**
3. Click **Change All** and confirm



#### Ubuntu

1. Select any G-code file
2. Right-click the file and select **Properties**
3. Select the **Open With** tab
4. Select **PrusaSlicer G-code Viewer** and click **Set as default**.



The process is similar on other Linux distributions.

### Features

The stand-alone G-Code Viewer shows names of used Printer/Print settings/Filament.

Once the final G-code is available after slicing, a new horizontal slider shows up, limiting visualization of extrusions and travel by time thus allowing simulation of the print in time. By default the new horizontal slider limits visualization of the last layer selected by the vertical toolbar. Alternatively the horizontal slider limits the extrusions in all layers selected by the vertical slider. In the first case, if the horizontal slider limits visibility of the top layer, then the other layers below are rendered in a gray color. We borrowed this visualization strategy from the Craftware user interface as Cura did.

The legend newly shows the print time and the print time fraction per feature (perimeter, infill etc.), and the legend labels serve as buttons to show / hide the particular extrusion time. The print time estimate is available in both the G-code preview after slicing and in the stand-alone G-code viewer.

#### Multiple instances

One can start as many PrusaSlicer G-code Viewers as he wishes either by opening a G-code from the "File->G-code preview" menu, by starting the G-code viewer application, or by double-clicking on a G-code file in a File Explorer/Finder.

### How it works

From the technical point of view, the stand-alone G-code viewer is a PrusaSlicer in disguise. The stand-alone G-code viewer is started as a new PrusaSlicer process. The way how the G-code viewer process is started is platform specific:

#### **Windows**

The PrusaSlicer.dll contains all the code while the prusa-slicer.exe, prusa-slicer-console.exe and the new prusa-gcodeviewer.exe wrappers just load PrusaSlicer.dll with the proper parameters.

#### **OSX**

The application distribution format supports a single binary, which in our case is PrusaSlicer.app/Contents/MacOS/PrusaSlicer. For command-line usage, this binary may be symlinked to prusa-gocdeviewer to start in a G-code viewer mode. Starting new instances of PrusaSlicer does not quite fit the OSX system, as the Finder only expects a single instance of a GUI application to be running. Thus when drag & dropping onto a dock icon of PrusaSlicer resp. G-code viewer, the file is sent to the first instance of PrusaSlicer resp. G-code viewer.

#### **Linux**

We support two binary distributions: AppImage and .tar.bz2. The .tar.bz2 format contains a new prusa-gcodeviewer starter script, while the AppImage may be symlinked to prusa-gcodeviewer to start the G-code viewer. The AppImage works by mounting the zipped filesystem image embedded inside the AppImage file and starting the application from there. It is not recommended to start prusa-gcodeviewer from an already mounted AppImage, as the AppImage will be unmounted when the PrusaSlicer that mounted it closes. When the user starts a G-code viewer from an AppImage PrusaSlicer application, another AppImage is mounted by the G-code viewer, which means the PrusaSlicer binary is being loaded into RAM the second time. Therefore if one is low on RAM, it is recommended to use the .tar.bz2 distribution instead of the AppImage until the AppImage is improved to support multiple processes running from a single mounted AppImage.

# [4. Electronics assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-electronics-assembly_193383)

- Slide the NYLON filament in the hole.

If the nylon is hidden inside the textile sleeve, use the technique in the previous step to reach it.

- Make sure the filament isn't pushing into the X-axis motor cable. This would indicate it is too long and you need to slightly unwrap the sleeve and push the filament back.

- Slide the sleeve in the holder at least 3/4 of the holder's height.

Again, ensure the filament isn't pushing the cables and if needed slightly unwrap the sleeve and push the filament up.

- Use the Extruder-cable-clip and two M3x10 screws to fix the cable bundle in place.

Older MK3 units may have a zip tie cable harness mounting. Use a zip tie to secure the textile sleeve.

**Do not overtighten the zip tie**

, you can damage the cables!

# [5. Y-axis upgrade](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-y-axis-upgrade_194395)

- Turn the printer so that the LCD is facing towards you.

- Move the Y-carriage all the way from you and cut two zip ties on the Y-rod-holders with the needle-nose pliers.

- Release four screws holding the Y-rod-holders. Do not throw away the screws, you will need them in the following step.

- Lift the smooth rod up, 1-2 cm (0.39 - 0.79 inch). **If you feel resistance, stop lifting!** Otherwise, you can damage the Y-rod-holder on the other end of the rod.

- Remove one Y-rod-holder from the printer.

- Push the new Y-rod-holder on the rod. Align the front surface of the plastic part with the flat surface of the rod.

- Check the correct position of the Y-rod-holder. The screw hole must be facing up and on the "inner" side of the Y-carriage (see the picture).

- Repeat these steps for the second Y-rod-holder.

The printer is displaying the message: **The Ambient temperature/UV LED temperature sensor failed.**

Error name: Temperature sensor failed

The SL1 has several sensors measuring the temperature of various parts and components of the printer. If a wire has been disconnected or damaged, or the sensor itself has been damaged it can produce this error.

### How to fix it?

#### Accessing the mainboard

First, make sure the plug of the sensor has not detached from the A64 mainboard. To access the mainboard:

1. Remove the 4 screws on the left and right-hand side of the printer.


2. Unplug the wire that goes to the front USB port, before sliding the front panel off.



You will now have full access to the mainboard and its connections. On the left picture, you can see the Ambient temperature sensor (thermistor) indicated by the yellow arrow, and the LED temperature sensor is connected together with its power cables, indicated by the green square.

#### Ambient temperature sensor

The sensor itself is found inside the tower, behind the back-plate. The sensor can be accessed by removing the screws on the sides

####

####

You can check the integrity of the ambient temperature sensor using a multimeter. Unplug it from the board and measure the resistance across the leads of the connector, as illustrated below. Set your meter to 200K to be within the correct range. More info in [Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117).

#### UV LED temperature sensor

This sensor is integrated into the LED PCB. If you receive the error that this has failed, check and reseat the connections of the led panel, but it may have to be replaced. It is an assembly with a heatsink and fan and can be accessed from the bottom of the printer.

# [Tilt check failed #10119 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tilt-check-failed-10119-sl1-sl1s_196064)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **Tilt axis check failed! Check if the tilt can move smoothly in its entire range.**

Error name: Tilt check failed

The inability to home the tilt might indicate that the tilt movement cannot be detected.

### How to fix it?

Use the steps below to check the tilt mechanism.

1. Open the eight M3x5b screws securing the cover. **Be careful to unplug the USB & Power-cable before removing the cover completely.**


2. Remove the M4x10 screw holding the right side of the touch screen. It is not necessary to remove the left screw. Just loosen it about a half-turn and you can slide the screen out, like a door. This will give you access to the motor and connecting rod.



Be very careful with the touch screen flat cable. It is fragile and can be easily damaged or cut.

3. Move the connecting rod with your hands and see if it has a full range of motion and if the blade sensor-trigger is between the two sides of the sensor. If so, jump to step 12. If any resistance is found, continue with the next step.


4. Remove the M3nN-nut from the screw that connects the tilt-mechanism and the connecting rod. You can do that by using a spanner or pliers to hold the nut and an Allen key to unscrew from the other side.


5. Remove the two M4x8 screws securing the tilt-motor holder to the bottom plate.


6. Remove the motor-holder and the connecting-rod from the tilt mechanism.
7. Go to [Step 18](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544#9384) of [2\. Base & Tower](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544) of the assembly guide, and remake the connection of the connecting rod and the motor shaft.



Pay extra attention to this step, as not aligning the connecting rod with the protrusion on the holder as instructed will cause the issue again.

8. Reassemble first the tilt to the connecting rod, make sure that after tightening the nut the two parts are in contact.



Do not over-tighten the nut!

9. Connect the motor holder to the bottom plate using the M4x8 screws.


10. Make sure that the optical sensor cable has its correct end connected to the sensor. The middle wire should be blue. In case the middle wire on the sensor connector is black, the connection will need to be swapped.
11. Move the connecting-rod manually and see if it moves smoothly until the blade sensor-trigger is between the two sides of the sensor.



Make sure the sensor is secured!

12. Slide the LCD back to its place, and tighten both M4x10 screws holding it.


13. Connect the USB and Power cable and close the eight M3x5b screws that hold the cover. Tighten them diagonally at first, and add all the screws before tightening them. Pay attention to the cables from the electronics so that they are not pinched.


14. Run the wizard again.

* Lightly textured surface finish
* Double-sided! Both sides can be used interchangeably.
* Prints automatically detach after the sheet cools down
* Wide range of supported filaments, including advanced materials (PC Blend, Polypropylene…)
* Easy maintenance and good adhesion qualities



### Considerations

* **Never clean the sheet with acetone! It will deteriorate the surface.**
* Keep the sheet clean! Any grease will greatly reduce adhesion.
* Live Z value needs to be readjusted if you switch sheets. See [Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955).
* Not scratch-resistant!!! Do not use metal spatulas etc. to remove the prints. We recommend printing a plastic spatula, like [this one.](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/28337-scraper-for-build-plate-version-2)
* Small PLA prints may require a [Brim](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/skirt-and-brim_133969#brim).
* Apply a glue stick when printing with TPU or TPEE.
* Prints from ASA and PC Blend have a lower adhesion on satin compared to on the smooth sheet. Prints often require brim and/or shield (skirt ["Draft shield" around the object](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/skirt-and-brim_133969#skirt) is a feature in PS 2.3)
* PC blend works perfectly with the clean satin sheet, however, it might cause wear after some time. **If you print PC often, a glue stick separation layer is recommended to prevent potential damage to the sheet.**



Consumable parts, such as print sheets (satin, smooth, textured, etc.) are not covered by warranty as the coatings will diminish over time. Unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship, cosmetic damage, including but not limited to scratches, dents, cracks, or other cosmetic damage is also not covered by the warranty. Only defective sheets on arrival are covered by warranty.

### Maintenance

* Attracts fingerprints - A good indication of where your sheet is dirty/greasy and that you need to clean it. Clean with ~90% IPA when the sheet is cold. If ~90% IPA is not sufficient, clean with dishwasher soap. **Do not leave the sheet wet!** It has an anti-corrosion layer but is still not recommended.
* Never clean with acetone! Same issue as with the textured sheet (surface deteriorates)
* Some types of paper towels may leave traces on the sheet (fiber pieces).



### Filaments

We have done a lot of testing and compiled our results for you to use. To easily see how to prepare your sheet for any filament type, please [see our Material table](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials).

### Prints don’t stick

If your print surface is perfectly clean and all grease has been removed by wiping it with a paper towel soaked in isopropyl alcohol ~90% and if the first layer height is set up perfectly, yet your print still does not adhere reliably to the print surface, check out [First layer issues](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804).

# [Textured steel sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/textured-steel-sheet_196534)

The Original Prusa magnetic heatbed is designed to hold a **removable double-sided flexible spring-steel sheet** , designed specifically for easy removal of printed objects from the print surface.

_Textured Sheet (color may differ from yours)_ _The underside of a printed object_

The powder-coated sheet, also referred to as the _textured sheet_ , has its surface covered with a special polymer (Ultem PEI) to ensure perfect adhesion. These have been used in our print farm for many years and are perfect when printing a lot of _high-adhesion_ filaments like PETG, and are also ideal for printing flexible filaments (TPU). It has a rougher texture than the [Satin sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/satin-steel-sheet_196526) and is more durable with some filaments than the [smooth sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/smooth-steel-sheet_196550) .

The exact color depicted in the e-shop and our knowledge base may differ from yours. All sheets are checked and verified being within tight specifications. These specifications are both considering the manufacturing method and the sheet's function (adhesion and durability used with certain material types), but not the cosmetic aspect of the sheet or pattern left on printed parts. **We can not guarantee the pattern left on your printed objects will match perfectly from sheet to sheet.**

### Main attributes

* Textured finish
* Double-sided! Both sides can be used interchangeably.
* Thinner than its smooth counterpart.
* Ideal for extensive printing of PETG, CPE, TPEE/TPU.
* No need for glue stick with flexible filaments (TPU/TPEE)
* Prints automatically detach after the sheet cools down
* To be cleaned with ~90% IPA or denaturd alcohol when cold. _Do not use anything made for skin!_ It can contain oils/sugars that ruin adhesion!



### Considerations

* **Never clean the sheet with acetone! It will deteriorate the surface!**
* Never apply ABS juice to it!
* Prints from ASA, ABS, Nylon and PC Blend require the application of a glue stick (separation layer).
* Live Z value needs to be readjusted if you switch sheets. See [Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955).
* Not scratch-resistant!!! Do not use metal spatulas etc. to remove the prints. We recommend printing a plastic spatula, like [this one.](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/28337-scraper-for-build-plate-version-2)
* Small PLA prints may require a [Brim](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/skirt-and-brim_133969#brim).



Consumable parts, such as print sheets (satin, smooth, textured, etc.) are not covered by warranty as the coatings will diminish over time. Unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship, cosmetic damage, including but not limited to scratches, dents, cracks, or other cosmetic damage is also not covered by the warranty. Only defective sheets on arrival are covered by warranty.

### Filaments

We have done a lot of testing and compiled our results for you to use. To easily see how to prepare your sheet for any filament type, please [see our Material table](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials).

### Prints don’t stick

If your print surface is perfectly clean and all grease has been removed by wiping it with a paper towel soaked in isopropyl alcohol ~90%. Also, make sure [the first layer height is set up perfectly.](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-i3_112364)

If your prints still do not adhere reliably to the print surface, try to wash the sheet in warm water (not hot!) with a few drops of liquid dish soap (not hand soap). This should not be done often, and **do not submerge the sheet completely in hot water** , bu this can clean away oils/sugars that are not affected by rubbing alcohol. However, the textured sheet is not water-proof so consider this a last resort which **should not be done often**.

# [Smooth Steel Sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/smooth-steel-sheet_196550)

The Original Prusa magnetic heatbed is designed to hold a **removable double-sided flexible spring-steel sheet** , designed specifically for easy removal of printed objects from the print surface.

____
_Smooth sheet (color may differ from yours)_ _The underside of a printed object_

Both sides of the smooth sheet are covered by a sticker made from PEI plastic. This is the same time-tested surface type that was used on the older MK2S printers. This sheet provides excellent adhesion with most filaments and geometry. So much in fact, that some filaments, like TPU and PETG, will adhere too much and can damage the sheet when removed. That is why we also have available the [Textured sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/textured-steel-sheet_196534) and the [Satin sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/satin-steel-sheet_196526).

### Main attributes

* Ideal for printing PLA, HIPS, ABS/ASA, composite materials (metal/wood).
* Prints with sharp corners or a small first-layer area are less likely to detach.
* Scratch-resistant. Can be used with a metal spatula, however, cosmetic scratches may appear.
* Double-sided! Both sides can be used interchangeably.
* Compatible with most types of filament.
* Thicker than the Textured and Satin sheet.
* Little to no surface preparation, (other than cleaning).
* Clean with ~90% Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) or denatured alcohol.
* Can be cleaned with acetone, but do not overuse it (1-2 times per month).
* ABS juice can be applied to the sheet.



### Considerations

* Live Z value needs to be readjusted if you switch sheet-type. See [Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955).
* Some filaments, like PETG, ASA, ABS and PC Blend, may need a protective separation layer, like gluestick applied thinly before printing! See our extensive [Material table.](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials).
* Keep the sheet clean! Any grease will greatly reduce adhesion.



### Maintenance

* Clean with ~90% IPA (isopropyl alcohol) or denatured alcohol when cold. Apply on unscented paper towel and rub the sheet down. _Do not use anything made for skin!_ It can contain oils that ruin adhesion!
* 1-2 times a month it can be cleaned the same way with acetone if IPA cleaning is not sufficient.
* After extended use (1-2 years) the surface can smooth out further, which affects adhesion. Using high-grit sandpaper (600-1000), the PEI can be revived by light sanding, bring fresh PEI to the surface. The sheet will have a very light texture after this treatment.
* The smooth PEI film on the steel sheet [can be replaced in case of extensive damage](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/replacing-the-pei-sheet-on-the-mk3s-mk3-mk2-5s-mk2-5_23920).



#### Bubbles underneath the PEI

Over time, you might see some small bubbles underneath the PEI. This is nothing serious. These bubbles usually do not affect print quality and will disappear after a few days or weeks. Here are 2 tips that will make these bubbles disappear faster:

1. Swap the side of the steel sheet you were printing on. This will speed up the "recovery" of the PEI surface.
Bubbles appear around the spot where you print the most (center of the sheet), most often underneath the corners of your printed parts.
2. When slicing the models, vary your placement on the print surface. Don't use just one spot i.e. the center.



#### Dent in the PEI

Sometimes, there might be a small dimple or dent in the smooth PEI layer when you first unpack the steel sheet. Don't worry, just flip the sheet over and use the other side. Thanks to the heat of the heatbed, the dent will disappear by itself after some time (about 1-2 days of print time).

_Bubbles under PEI sheet_ _Dents in PEI_

Consumable parts, such as print sheets (satin, smooth, textured, etc.) are not covered by warranty as the coatings will diminish over time. Unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship, cosmetic damage, including but not limited to scratches, dents, cracks, or other cosmetic damage is also not covered by the warranty.

# [PVB](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pvb_196708)

### **Basic info**

Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) is a material designed for easy smoothing with isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Thanks to its transparency, it’s suitable for printing vases, lamp shades and other design objects. Print settings are similar to PLA, while its mechanical properties are slightly better.

**Recommended nozzle temperature:** 215±10 °C

**Recommended bed temperature:** 75 °C

**Heatbed:** Smooth PEI or satin TXT sheet will provide the best adhesion.

### Description

[**PVB**](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/prusament-pvb/) (Polyvinyl butyral) has similar print settings to PLA, mechanical properties are comparable with CPE or low-tier PETG. Thanks to its translucency and IPA smoothing, it is an ideal choice when you want to make design objects, such as unconventional vases, jewellery, lamp shades and similar objects. The most ideal are models that require partially transparent surface. It’s recommended to tweak print settings, especially layer height, number of perimeters and infill density. We recommend printing with large nozzle diameter and spiral vase mode.

PVB is not suitable for printing mechanical parts. Its dimensional stability is great, tenacity and tensile strength is comparable to CPE (and low-tier PETG) but temperature resistance is similar to PLA.

Since it's an easy-to-print material (similar to PLA), PVB is a great choice for both experienced and new 3D printer users that would like to try something new.

To compare supported material properties, see our [**material table.**](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials)

✔ Print settings similar to PLA

✖ Low layer to layer adhesion

✖ Hygroscopic filament (absorbs moisture)

✔ Ideal for design parts, vases, lamp shades etc.

✔ Good tenacity (similar to CPE)

✔ Good tensile strength (similar to PETG)

✔ Low warping (lower than PLA)

✔ Good for using 0.8mm nozzle

### Best use

The best use of PVB is for printing transparent models, such as jewellery, vases, lamp shades etc.

### Tips for successful printing

**Do not use standard powder-coated TXT sheet**

PVB adheres well to a clean **smooth PEI sheet** or **satin TXT sheet**. Powder-coated TXT sheet might not provide a good adhesion.

When printing transparent parts that require IPA smoothing, it’s good to print with a larger nozzle diameter (0.8mm) and with the spiral vase mode on. Printing with more perimeters will make layers visible even after IPA smoothing.

The main advantage of PVB is the possibility of IPA smoothing. PVB models can be smoothed out with IPA fumes (smoothing box or professional smoothing station), washing in an IPA bath or direct application (brush or spray). Detailed smoothing description can be found in our

[dedicated article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/prusament-pvb-our-new-transparent-filament-made-for-easy-chemical-smoothing_43066/)

, general smoothing instructions can be found in our

[older article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/improve-your-3d-prints-with-chemical-smoothing_36268/)

.

**PVB is very prone to absorbing moisture.** Always put the spool back inside the bag with silica gel or **let it dry** for 8 hours at 45 °C before printing!

# [Search function](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/search-function_196752)

PrusaSlicer lets you search for a parameter to quickly access a particular settings page and parameter field. The search is accessible from both the Plater top toolbar and from the Print/Filament/Printer parameter pages, or with the familiar Ctrl+F shortcut.

The search respects the currently selected mode. If you're in the **Simple mode** the search will only search for parameters and settings visible in the Simple mode.

A modified fuzzy search algorithm by @forrestthewoods is used, which works similarly to the fuzzy search algorithm in Sublime editor. If the application is switched to a local language, both the localized names and English names are searched through. ASCII folding is applied, so one may for example type "cistici vez" to search for "Čistící věž".

# [Sending G-codes to printer via network (PrusaConnect, PrusaLink, Octoprint)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sending-g-codes-to-printer-via-network-prusaconnect-prusalink-octoprint_196761)

PrusaSlicer separates the printer connection settings from the Printer profile into a **Physical printer** profile.

You can create a new Physical profile by clicking _**Add printer**_ in the printer profile select box or by clicking the cog icon and picking **_Add physical printer_**.

In the Physical printer dialog, you can name the printer and assign it one **or more** printer profiles. If you're using, for example, the MMU2S upgrade, you only have to set one physical printer, but you can have both Single mode and MMU profiles linked to it.

If you have a Physical printer with network info filled out selected as your current printer, you can send generated G-codes directly to your device.

### PrusaConnect

If you'd like to send files to your printer via PrusaConnect, add a Physical printer or Edit an existing one.

Select _**PrusaConnect**_ from the select box as the _**Host**_ **type** _._ The hostname/IP will be automatically filled, you don't have to change it.

To find your API key, go to PrusaConnect, select the printer you want to send the files to, go to the _**Settings**_ tab and scroll down to he _**API keys**_ section. Copy _**PrusaConnect API key**_ to the Physical printer window and confirm with OK.

# [2. YZ - axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-yz-axis-assembly_196824)

- Move the Y-carriage all the way from you.

- Using a finger on your left hand push the belt down. Some force should be needed for bending the belt, BUT don't try to overstretch the belt as you might damage the printer.

- You can change the tension in the belt by adjusting the two screws on the MINI-Y-plate-front:

-  **Tighten the screw** , bring the MINI-Y-belt-idler closer and thus increase the overall tension.

-  **Release the screw** , parts will move apart, the overall tension will decrease.

- Use the technique described below to test if the belt is properly stretched.

- Use pliers to hold the Y-axis motor shaft.

- Move the Y-carriage with your hand towards the Y-axis motor. Don't use excessive force.

- If the belt is stretched properly, you should feel a resistance and the Y-carriage won't move at all. If the belt is too loose, it will deform (create a "wave") and jump over the teeth on the pulley.

---

# [3. X-axis & Extruder assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-x-axis-extruder-assembly_199519)

- Insert and slightly tighten two M3x12 screws into the X-end.

There is no nut used here. Use more force to tighten the screws into the plastic part.

**Be careful,**

not to hurt yourself.

- Do not tighten the screws completely. Leave a half of the screw head protruding above the surface of the plastic part.

- Slide one bearing on each smooth rod.

Don't forget to

**wipe off the residue of the grease on the smooth rods**

with a paper towel.

- Push the MINI-X-end all the way on the smooth rods. **Before pushing the part on the smooth rods, check if there are no obstructions inside the holes.**

- Check the correct orientation of the part. The screw holes on the MINI-X-end must face up and the screws on the MINI-Z-carriage-front must face up.

- Insert and slightly tighten two M3x12 screws into the X-end. We'll completely tighten them later.

# [XYZ Calibration (MK2.5/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/xyz-calibration-mk2-5-mk2-5s_199651)

The XYZ calibration is a process, which checks, whether the printer was assembled correctly and the axes are perpendicular to each other. It measures the skew of your X/Y axis and applies compensations for any imperfections. It may indicate two sets of error messages **compromised/failed.** See below for a detailed description.

XYZ calibration is a part of the **Wizard** , which will appear on the first boot or after a factory reset. In case you have skipped the Wizard, you can start it manually from the _LCD Menu - Calibration - Wizard._

If you wish to redo the XYZ calibration and you have finished the **Selftest** successfully, you can start the XYZ calibration separately through the _LCD Menu - Calibration - XYZ cal._

### P.I.N.D.A V2 or SuperPINDA

There are several versions of our auto-leveling probe. The table below outlines their history and compatibility across the Original Prusa printers.

**Printer** **Initial sensor** **Replaced by**
MK2/SP.I.N.D.A. V1-
**MK2.5 and MK2.5S** **P.I.N.D.A. V2** **SuperPINDA**
MK3, MK3S and MK3S+P.I.N.D.A. V2SuperPINDA

To identify the type of leveling probe you have installed, you can look to its wire:

* The **P.I.N.D.A. V2 is black with no markings** (left picture) **.**
* The **SuperPINDA has orange text on the wire**, close to the probe (right picture). The SuperPINDA's connector also only has three wires, while the P.I.N.D.A. V2 has four due to its integrated thermistor.



_P.I.N.D.A. V2 - Without markings_ _SuperPINDA - With markings_

For **MK2.5/MK2.5S printers, which have the SuperPINDA** installed, you **MUST use firmware version 3.9.3, or above.** In addition to this, you must let the printer know you have the SuperPINDA installed, and not the P.I.N.D.A. V2, by navigating to _LCD Menu - > Settings -> HW settings -> SuperPINDA -> **ON.**_

### Calibration walkthrough

1. The printer will start the calibration by aligning the Z-axis. **You spin the selector knob clockwise until both ends of the X-axis reached the top, and then one extra turn to ensure it has reached it fully**. The printer will then ask if it is at the top. Select Yes.
2. In the next step, the printer asks whether you have the steel sheet on the heated bed. **R** **em** **ove the steel sheet for the upcoming initial 4 point calibration now and select No.**
3. Check that the **nozzle is clean** and confirm the on-screen prompt.
4. Place a sheet of paper (e.g. the included cheat sheet) between the nozzle and the heatbed. If the nozzle catches the paper, **immediately** press the **Reset button.** Your sensor is probably set too high. Lower it down by 2 - 3 threads and run the XYZ calibration again. More info below.



**Do not leave the printer unattended during this calibration, otherwise, you may end up with a scratched heatbed. The paper is just an indicator, not protection!!!**

5. Once the first routine finishes, **place the steel sheet on the heated bed and confirm the on-screen prompt**. The printer will perform a full 9 point mesh bed leveling. All of the measured compensations will be stored in non-volatile memory.



For more details on the XYZ calibration procedure's inner workings, please [see the Github changelog](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/releases/tag/v3.9.3).

### Troubleshooting the XYZ calibration

If you encounter any error messages, there is most likely something wrong with the assembly of your printer.

**Please perform the following tasks:**

1. Make sure you followed the instructions on the LCD precisely. Especially make sure that the X-axis moved to the very top. Otherwise, the Z-axis might be misaligned.
2. Make sure that the cable harness leading from the extruder, or the zip ties securing it, does **not hit the cover of the miniRAMBo board** before it reaches the end of the X-axis.
3. Make sure your [belts are at the correct tension](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mk3-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5-mk4_112380).
4. Double-check that there's a 100mm (3.937inches) distance between the Y-corners and the frame (green ruler). The start and endpoint of this distance are indicated by the blue arrows.


5. Navigate to LCD menu - Calibration - Auto-home. The P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor must stop right in the center of the 1st calibration point (please refer to the photos below). If it does not align it may indicate an issue with the Y-corner length explained in the previous step (step 4).


6. Check the [E-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_28536). Make sure that the hotend is correctly inserted in the extruder. The heatsink must be slotted into both slots (green arrows), the short side of the heater block is facing forward (orange ruler), with its wires running back alongside the left side of the heater block (blue arrow). More info on this in [Failing Z calibration (MK3S/MK2.5S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/failing-z-calibration-mk3s-mk2-5s_160858).


7. Make sure nothing blocks the movement of any of the axis. You can easily test that by moving the extruder or heatbed through **LCD Menu - Settings - Move axis (X/Y).** Simply move it from one end to the other and inspect the movement.
8. Make sure that your P.I.N.D.A. or SuperPINDA sensor is roughly 1 mm higher than the tip of the nozzle. Distancing the sensor is covered in the assembly manual Part [6\. Preflight check](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-preflight-check_53592).


9. There is also a small possibility that your P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor could be defective. The easiest way how to check that is to navigate to _LCD Menu - Support - Sensor info._ While placing anything metal (e.g. a spatula) under the sensor, the "P.I.N.D.A." value should **change from** **0 to 1 and the light should go out**. More information can be found in [P.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA Sensor testing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/p-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing_2091).



If you have just recently updated your Firmware version and XYZ calibration is

**repeatedly**

failing without any clear reason, we recommend doing a

[full system refresh](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/full-system-refresh-original-prusa-i3_133258)

# [Upgrading MK2/S and MK2.5/S to MK2.5S+](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/upgrading-mk2-s-and-mk2-5-s-to-mk2-5s_200009)

This article describes all the components necessary to upgrade your Original Prusa i3 MK2/MK2S/MK2.5/MK2.5S to the latest iteration of the hardware and software available from Prusa Research. For all intents and purposes let's use a codename "MK2.5S+", but please note two important things:

* **"MK2.5S+" is not an official upgrade** and the complete package won't be available on the e-shop. You have to purchase the listed parts separately.
* From the point of firmware and software (PrusaSlicer) use files for the Original Prusa MK2.5S.



**This upgrade gives you the best features of MK3S+**

* Magnetic bed with spring steel sheet
* New extruder head with Bondtech
* Hotend fan with advanced RPM management
* SuperPINDA bed leveling sensor
* IR filament sensor



**Don't disassemble your printer, before you read the entire article!**

You need first to decide, which parts you will upgrade and you have to print them!

**Important!** While getting the components for your printer, make sure all the components are compatible! **MK2/MK2.5 family of printers runs on 12 V!** Don't buy parts, which require 24 V.

### Which parts can be upgraded?

Based on the printer you currently have, there are multiple upgrades available. Learn below, which are compatible with your printer and which are not. Before you buy or print any part, double-check it will work with your printer. Also, if you have the MK2.5/MK2.5S printer you might already have some parts installed and you can reuse them.

In case you purchase parts from the Prusa e-shop, note that some parts are already bundled to the main part (e.g. to the heatbed set) and there is no need to get them separately. The fasteners might differ slightly in your country (dimensions, thread type).

### **Extruder**

**Applicable to:** MK2, MK2S, MK2.5, MK2.5S

the biggest upgrade is the new extruder, which is entirely redesigned to provide better performance while printing and reducing the overall noise. You have to print new extruder parts, get the new electronics, fasteners, and some other accessories. Also, note that the new extruder design will work correctly only with the new magnetic heatbed MK52.

### **Heatbed**

The second important update is the new magnetic heatbed MK52 with removable flexible steel sheets. You can get multiple steel sheets with different surface finish and change them quickly based on your needs. Note that the new magnetic heatbed will work correctly only with the new extruder design described above.

In a rare case, when your printer is still using the zip ties to hold the Y-carriage and Y-axis bearings together, it is highly recommended to change them for U-bolts. _The bearing clips introduced with the Original Prusa MK3S **+** are not compatible._

### Incompatible upgrades

#### **Bearing clips**

A new retaining system, which is holding the bearings in the Y-carriage. Bearing clips are replacing the previously used U-bolts. Changing U-bolts for clips will bring no extra performance. Also note that you have to adjust and reprint one Y-corner, as the bearing clip will hit it before the Y-axis endstop is triggered.

#### **X-ends with the tensioning system**

Few months after releasing the initial design of the Original Prusa i3 MK3 the X-ends on the X-axis were updated with a tensioning system providing easier assembly. However, this part brings no extra performance. The design is not compatible with the MK2.5 family as it doesn't have a mounting system for the X-axis endstop.

### Printed parts

All the upgrades above require some printed parts, we have prepared a bundle including all of them. Use the link below to download it. Read the recommended settings and materials before you arrange them in your slicer. The arrangement below is used as an example, yours can differ. The smallest parts might sometimes detach during the print, it is a good practice to print them in a separate print.

Download here: [MK2.5S+ printed parts bundle](https://prusa3d.com/downloads/others/MK2toMK25S+_upgrade_stl.zip)

#### Recommended print settings

* Layer height: 0.2 mm
* Infill: 20 %
* Infill type: grid



#### Recommended print materials

All materials listed below can be used. The black color is recommended, in case you want to use a different color, make sure the space surrounding the IR-sensor is dark and protected from the outside light (namely for the translucent materials).

* **PETG** \- the majority of the printed parts for Prusa printers are designed, tested and printed using PETG. This is why this material is recommended. The only exception is fan-shroud, which should be printed from ASA or PC.
* **ASA** \- you can use this material, but keep in mind, it is ideal to use a chamber around the printer to maintain the temperature, also due to the different material properties, the final dimensions of the printed part may slightly differ.
* **PC** \- you can use this material, but keep in mind, it is ideal to use a chamber around the printer to maintain the temperature, also due to the different material properties, the final dimensions of the printed part may slightly differ.
* **ABS** \- in case you have ABS at home, you can use it. However, ABS tends to warp and you might have to use a partial brim around the objects (at corners) to prevent them from lifting from the print sheet.



**Type** **Item** **Amount** **Note**
FilamentPrusament PETG Black ([e-shop](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-petg-jet-black-1kg/))11kg spool is enough, recommended material

### Update manual(s)

For the upgrade to MK2.5S+, you can use the guide "MK2/S to MK2.5S upgrade". Pay attention to the extruder upgrade chapter, which was created for the previous MK2.5S design, but you will be assembling the MK3S+ extruder design, which is visually slightly different. However, the assembly procedure is almost the same.

**WARNING:** for all printer types you need to **replace the PTFE in the hotend with the MK3S+ version** (different length, shape)

# [4. Print head & Heatbed assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-print-head-heatbed-assembly_201450)

- Insert two M3x8 screws to the heatbed. Screw heads must be on the top surface of the heatbed.

- Turn the heatbed bottom up and place it like in the picture.

- Place the red wire (+) on the left screw.

- Place the black wire (-) on the right screw.

- Attach two M3nN nuts onto both screws and tighten them **firmly**.

- The cable cover, which will be applied later requires the connectors to be slightly inclined towards each other. Hold them in the position as seen in the picture while tightening, but leave a small gap between them. Ensure the cable lugs can't move after tightening.

**Make sure the cables are connected properly and the screws are tightened fully.**

Improper wiring or loose connection to the heatbed can fatally damage the electronics.

---

# [5. LCD assembly & Electronics](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-lcd-assembly-electronics_202703)

- Before covering the electronics, make sure the square nut is correctly positioned in the printed part. **The nut must not fall out!** This can cause fatal damage to the electronics.

- Insert the "teeth" of the cover into the grooves of the MINI-Z-bottom.

-  **Place the second cover on the top and arrange the cables:**

-  **Extruder bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially in. Also, it must be tilted away from the printer.

-  **Heatbed bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially inside the box.

-  **Filament sensor cable** (optional), ensure that the textile sleeve wrapped around the cables is partially inside the box.

- Now, tighten the second cover. Check that no cable is pinched.

---

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_203948)

**To successfully finish the assembly please complete each of the following:**

-  **Always read all the instructions at the current step first**. This will help you to understand, what you need to do. **Don't cut or trim unless you are told to!!!**

-  **Don't follow pictures only!** It is not enough, the written instructions are as brief as they can be. Read them.

-  **Read the comments** from the other users. They are a great source of ideas. We read them too and based on your feedback improve the manual and the entire assembly.

-  **Use a reasonable force.** The printed parts are tough, but not unbreakable. If it doesn't fit, check your approach twice.

-  **Eat the gummy bears as instructed!** Disobedience won't be tolerated :D

-  **Most important: Enjoy the build, have fun.** Cooperate with your kids, friends or partners. _However, we take no responsibility for possible fights ;)_

- Ready for more? Let's move to the next chapter: **2\. YZ - axis assembly**

---

# [7. Preflight check](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/7-preflight-check_204705)

- Using your fingers turn the lead screw and move the entire X-axis down. **Stop when the hotend touches the heatbed! Avoid bending the heatbed!**

- Release slightly the screw on the MINI-minda-holder so you are able to adjust the position of the SuperPINDA sensor.

- Take a zip tie from the package and place it under the SuperPINDA sensor. Use the middle part of the zip tie, not the tip.

- Gently press the SuperPINDA sensor down against the zip tie.

- Tighten the screw on the MINI-minda-holder. **Do not use excessive force.** Otherwise, you can break the printed part!

- Rotate the lead screw manually in the opposite direction to move the axis at least 5 mm up.

# [6B. Spool holder assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6b-spool-holder-assembly_204973)

- Take two of the BASE parts and insert the M3n nuts into the holes in both of them - see the picture (they are identical). If you can't push them in, insert a screw from the opposite side to pull them in.

- Flip one of the BASE parts and insert two bearings in it.

- Put the second BASE part on top of the bearings.

- Insert the M3x12 screw from the top and tighten it. Flip the base assembly over and do the same.

- Make sure both bearings can rotate freely. If not, release the screw(s) slightly.

- Repeat this step for the second base assembly.

# [Orders to the UK](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/orders-to-the-uk_205772)

From January 2021, the UK officially exited the EU (Brexit), which changed a lot of the terms of shipping and commerce with EU member states, like the Czech Republic. Changes are not uniform across the whole of the UK, so here we will outline the details and conditions for each constituent country. These terms are set as a result of the UK's negotiations with the EU, and not by the companies or enterprises conducting trade across these borders.

### General Info

Prusa Research has applied for a UK VAT number and will collect the 20% UK VAT for orders up to 135 GBP (VAT excl.) which will be paid by us to the UK Government (HMRC). We have a VAT number pending and it will be included in the tax invoices once processed. It can then be downloaded from your profile pages of our e-shop or provided by our customer support.

There will be two separate shipping destinations (countries) in our e-shop. **You must always choose the correct location according to the shipping address as different tax rules apply.**

* United Kingdom
* United Kingdom - Northern Ireland



### United Kingdom

Due to the EU - UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), **no customs duties will be applied to orders shipped to the United Kingdom (UK) from the Czech Republic. However, the carrier may charge processing-fee.**

#### Purchase made by an individual (B2C)

* Orders of an amount up to 135 GBP (VAT excl.), included shipping cost: 20% tax charged at the time of purchase.
* Orders of an amount above 135 GBP (VAT excl.): No tax charged at the time of purchase. However, UK taxes will be applied upon arrival, based on UK law. For details please see [the official documentation provided by your government](https://gov.uk).

# [Info Screens (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/info-screens-mini-mini_206605)

In the Original Prusa MINI and MINI+ menu, you can see the option _Info._ Here you will find different information on your printer.

**Within the Info menu you have the following selection:**

* System info
* Sensor info
* Version info
* Statistics



### System info

* **CPU load (%)**
* **Date and time:** From the [NTP server](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ntp-server-mini_151132) if the printer is connected to the internet.
* **Fan0:** Print fan RPM (Revolutions Per Minute).
* **Fan1:** Hotend fan RPM.



To test the print fan RPM outside of the print, go in the printer's menu to

_Settings - > Temperature -> Fan_

, and change the fan value to 255 (max). The hotend fan will automatically start when the hotend is heated above 50 ºC.

### Sensor info

* **Filament sensor:** In case you have the optional filament sensor installed in your Mini, **this entry will show 0 when the filament is not loaded on the sensor and 1 when the filament is loaded.** _If the Filament sensor is not installed it will show N/A._
* **M.I.N.D.A.:** The M.I.N.D.A. status will be 0 when it is not close to any metal, such as the heatbed. It will be at 1 when there is any metal directly under it, like when it is close to the heatbed.



The menu may show "M.I.N.D.A." even if you have the SuperPINDA installed.

### Version info

* **Firmware version**
* **Bootloader version**
* **Buddy board revision**



### Statistics

Starting firmware version 4.3.3, the printer stores information about the length of filament used and print time, as well as the distance traveled at each axis (X, Y, Z). **This is displayed in meters.**

All print data is stored in the EEPROM. To optimize the number of writes to the memory, only finished or stopped prints are saved. _In the case of a watchdog reset mid-print, the data is not stored._

This feature can help you plan [the maintenance of the printer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/regular-maintenance-mini_133222). Once bearings or other components reach a certain threshold, you'll know when to clean, maintain or replace anything.

The printer is capable of storing a print time of 9999 days 99 hours. The first user to reach this value

**without any tricks**

will become a grandmaster of 3D printing.

# [Selftest (SL1)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-sl1_209174)

When first turning on your SL1 printer, or after a [factory reset](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-sl1-sl1s_177524), the printer will ask to start the selftest. You can also start the Selftest in the printer menu in _Settings - > Calibration -> Wizard_. The selftest checks the most important functions of the printer.

### Selftest procedure checks

1. **Tank** home check
2. **Tower** home check
3. **UV led** check
4. **Fans** check
5. **Display** test
6. **Tower** axis check
7. **Resin sensor** check
8. Set timezone
9. Sound test



If any issue is found on the Selftest, a screen with the error will appear with a

[QR code](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/qr-error-codes_176114)

that will lead you to a troubleshooting guide.

### Tank home check

The tank home check will start the selftest by checking the tilt for movement and if it can find the homing position. Any error in this process can generate the following message:

### Tower home check

The tower is also checked for the range of movement and home position. Any error in this process can generate the following messages:

### UV LED check

After the mechanical checks for the tank and the tower, the printer will ask you to unscrew and remove the tank and the print platform. The UV LED will be checked.

[Temperature sensor failed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/temperature-sensor-failed-10205-sl1-sl1s_196016)

### Fans check

The SL1 has multiple fans. They are checked during the selftest, and if one of them has something blocking it, is not well connected, or has damage, the following errors can be presented, and in case this happens, the fan will be identified in the message:

### Display test

The printer will ask if you can see the Prusa sign from the top of the orange cover. **Do not open the orange cover, there is a UV light inside, which will cause damage to your eyes.** In case you click that you cannot see the logo, you will see the following message:

### Tower axis check

This step will check the tower axis for its full range of motion. In case there is an issue, one of the following messages might appear:

[Tower endstop not reached](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tower-endstop-not-reached-10114-sl1-sl1s_176352)

### Resin sensor check

After inserting the print platform at 60º, the resin sensor will be checked. In case the sensor is not found, the following error will be shown:

### Set timezone

At this step, you can set the timezone for your printer. The step is optional.

### Sound test

The printer will play a sound, and if you click that you cannot hear it, the following message will appear:

---

# [Download failed #10404 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/download-failed-10404-sl1-sl1s_210123)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **The download failed. Check the connection to the internet and try again.**

Error name: Download failed

### How to fix it?

There are two ways to connect the SL1 to the internet. You can use a standard RJ-45 ethernet cable. Connect it to your router, and the printer should obtain an IP address automatically - however, this depends on your network configuration. Since every network is different, please refer to your router’s instructions or your provider’s tech support in case you run into trouble. To check whether the connection has been successfully created, go to _Main Menu - Settings - Network_.

It is also possible to use the built-in Wi-fi network card compatible with 2.4GHz networks. To open the Wi-Fi network browser, go to Settings - Network. A list of all available networks will be displayed. Select your Wi-Fi network and connect to it by typing your password using the on-screen touch keyboard. You can connect a USB keyboard to the front USB port in case the on-screen keyboard is too small.

Since every network is different, we cannot provide exact instructions on how to connect to your wireless/wired network. If you encounter any trouble, please refer to your router’s manual, or contact your internet provider’s tech support. The quality of your wireless connection depends on many factors - such as the type/configuration of the router, the distance of the printer from the router, or wireless (EMI) interference in your area.

# [How to replace bearings on the Y-axis (MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-bearings-on-the-y-axis-mk3s_210152)

- Take the Y-belt-tensioner (bigger of the two printed parts).

- Insert M3n nut, all the way in.

Use the screw pulling technique.

- Bend second end of the belt around the screw and push it in the holder as in the picture. Use an Allen key to push the belt in.

- Make sure the bent part and the end are within the width of the printed part.

- Teeth on the belt must be facing up!

- Tighten the screw until you reach the nut, don't over tighten the screw, you will deform the belt.

- Hold the nut from the other side until the screw reaches its thread.

---

# [How to replace bearings on the X-axis (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-bearings-on-the-x-axis-mini-mini_211680)

- Move the MINI-x-carriage all the way to the Z-carriage.

- Using a finger on your left hand push the belt down in the center of the X-axis. Some force should be needed for bending the belt, BUT don't try to overstretch the belt as you might damage the printer.

- Adjust it by releasing or tightening both screws on the MINI-x-end.

-  **Release the screws,** bring the MINI-x-end closer to rods and thus decrease the overall tension.

- Tighten the screws, MINI-x-end will move apart, the overall tension will increase.

# [How to replace bearings on the Y-axis (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-bearings-on-the-y-axis-mini-mini_212861)

This is a

**VERY IMPORTANT**

part of the assembly, which can significantly influence the printer's behavior.

**PLEASE**

read the following lines carefully!

- Place the Y-carriage on a flat surface. Orientation doesn't matter.

- Insert linear bearing in the cutout and secure it by U-bolt. Pay attention to the correct orientation.

- Hold thumb on the U-bolt and turn the carriage. Place M3nN nuts on both ends of the U-bolt.

- Start tightening the nuts, **BUT ENSURE** you are tightening both nuts equally and **AS SOON AS EACH NUT REACHES THE SURFACE OF THE Y-CARRIAGE STOP TIGHTENING!!!** We will finish tightening the nuts in the next step.

- Repeat these steps for the remaining two linear bearings.

# [How to replace bearings on the X-axis (MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-bearings-on-the-x-axis-mk3s_214556)

In this step, we will finish adjusting the belt tension. Please read the instructions first, your belt might have proper tension set already, then there is no need for additional screw adjustment.

- First, slightly release all the screws holding the motor. Otherwise, the "tensioner" won't work (the motor must be able to move).

- Using ball-end Allen key start tightening the screw on the rear side of the X-end-motor, but after each turn or two check the tension in the belt.

- For the optimal performance, the belt must feel stiff if you pinch it with your fingers. Move the extruder all the way to the X-end-idler and try the belt tension in the middle of the X-axis.

- When you achieve an optimal tension, please tighten the screws up again.

In case you are experiencing X-axis failures during calibration or skipped layers in the X direction, adjust this screw accordingly. Tightening the screw stretches the belt. Releasing the screw has the opposite effect. And don't forget to release the screws on the motor first :)

# [How to replace a hotend heater (MK3S/MK3S+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-heater-mk3s-mk3s_221422)

- Wrap the entire length of the sleeve around the cable bundle.

- Using your fingers gently twist the sleeve (not the cables) and create several wraps. This will prevent the cables inside to slip out during the printing.

- Twisting the sleeve will effectively shorten its length, so then the nylon filament inside the cable bundle can easily reach the hole in the plastic electronics box (Einsy-base).

- Push the nylon filament into the hole in the plastic cable clip on the einsy-base.

**Ensure the nylon filament isn't pushing the motor cables**

and if needed slightly unwrap the sleeve and push the filament up.

- Slide the sleeve in the holder at least 3/4 of the holder's height.

- Use the Extruder-cable-clip and two M3x10 screws to fix the cable bundle in place.

# [First Layer Calibration (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-calibration-mini-mini_229122)

The First Layer Calibration is used to calibrate the distance between the tip of the nozzle and the print surface. The aim is to adjust the nozzle height until the extruded plastic sticks nicely to the bed and you can see that it is being slightly squished.

With a newly assembled or factory reset printer, the 'Z height' value will start at zero and move into a negative (-) value when you are reducing the distance between the nozzle and heat bed. The initial zero-value is set by the SuperPINDA/M.I.N.D.A. position. Turn the knob counter-clockwise to bring the nozzle closer to the bed and moving the value away from zero.

The value is unique to each printer and it may also slightly change with time and use. **You must, therefore, check visually when adjusting the height, not by a set value.**

**Turn the knob counter-clockwise to bring the nozzle closer to the bed.**

### Calibration procedure

The first layer calibration is the last part of the setup wizard. It can also be run at any time from _LCD-menu - > Calibration -> First layer calibration._

Before you proceed, make sure that the print surface (smooth or textured steel sheet) is clean. You can find information on how to clean it in [PEI print surface preparation](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804).

### Smooth Sheet

#### Too high

You want the line flattened, but not squished. On the square at the end of the test line, you do not want any gaps between the lines (left picture), which means it is too high. In that case, the value will be too close to zero. Prints will not adhere and can come loose during printing, which can, in turn, [cause a blob](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extruder-blob_2005).

#### Too low

If the nozzle is set too low (right picture) you will see the line squished completely flat and the end square will have ridges between the lines. This is a clear sign of the nozzle being too close. The value will then be too far away from zero. When it is too low, the edges of the square can also start curling upwards. In the extreme, the filament will be spread so thin you will be able to see through the printed filament. This will clog your hotend.

#### Just right

A correct adjustment will show you an even surface (center picture), with no gaps, nor ridges, between the lines. As stated, the numeric value depends on the exact position of the SuperPINDA/M.I.N.D.A. sensor, which will be unique to each machine and means nothing without a visual reference. **However, a common range is from -0.400 to -1.900.**

**If you reach -2.000 and the nozzle is still not close enough to the bed**

, raise the SuperPINDA/M.I.N.D.A. probe slightly higher (0,5 - 1mm) in its holder and restart the first layer calibration from zero.

_Nozzle adjusted too high_ _Nozzle adjusted perfectly_ _Nozzle adjusted too close_

### Textured sheet

The textured sheets are thinner than the sheets with smooth PEI, therefore you need to move the nozzle bit closer, but you are seeking the same results as with the smooth sheet. Again, if it is set too low (right picture) the filament can start curling up around the edges like it is not adhering. The numeric value will be too far from zero and must be adjusted back.

If set too high, you will see the line being round, and have gaps between the lines of the end-square. In this case, the value is too close to zero.

**If you reach -2.000 and the nozzle is still not close enough to the bed**

, raise the SuperPINDA/M.I.N.D.A. probe slightly higher (0,5 - 1mm) in its holder and restart the first layer calibration from zero.

### When to run the first layer calibration

Generally, the first layer calibration **should be performed every time there is a major change in the assembly. This includes changing the nozzle, extruder upgrades, or other updates to any axis.** You should also run all calibrations if you move the printer to a different location.

For First Layer Calibrations with other nozzle diameters than 0.4 mm, please see [this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/different-nozzle-types_2193#first-layer-calibration-of-other-nozzles).

### Steel sheet profiles

Since the thickness of the different flexible steel sheets varies with the type, you will require a separate Live Z adjustment for each sheet. Therefore the printer offers 'Steel sheet profiles', where you can set a first layer calibration for each sheet you may have. More info in [Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955).

# [IR Filament Sensor Troubleshooting (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-troubleshooting-mini-mini_230431)

When purchasing the Original Prusa MINI+, kit or semi-assembled, there is an option to add a filament sensor to the printer. It can also be purchased separately later.

This sensor assembly uses an IR sensor which is triggered by a mechanical lever. The electronics are the same as in the filament sensor assembly of the Original Prusa MK2.5S, MK3S, and MK3S+.

The sensor assembly is attached to the PTFE tube that leads into the extruder. If the filament runs out, the printer will pause your print, unload the remaining filament, and wait for a new filament to be loaded.

**Make sure the filament sensor is activated!** Go in the printer menu to Settings -> Fil. sens. [On/Off]. Settings can reset during a firmware update or factory reset.

### How to test the sensor

When the IR filament sensor is installed, you can see its status in the printer's menu under _Info - > Sensor info:_

* **1 - Filament loaded**
* **0 - Filament unloaded**
* **N/A - Sensor is not activated or installed incorrectly.**



If the sensor has been installed, activated and the status remains N/A, check the IR filament sensor cable connections on the sensor and on the Buddy board:

* The cable connector that goes into the board has a safety latch on one side. Make sure that this is locked in place when connected to the board. Check if the black wire is towards the Z-tower (front of the printer) and the red wire is towards the PSU connector (back of the printer).
* On the sensor side of the cable, make sure the latch faces the same direction as the components on the chip.
* Confirm the sequence of colors and their direction according to the pictures below.
* Make sure the [firmware is the latest version](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-mini-mini_124784).



### Filament sensor detected, but not working

In case the printer does not detect a filament runout, there might be two issues:

* **The lever is stuck**
* **Malfunctioning sensor**



To access the sensor for testing, unscrew the two M3x12 screws on each end of the sensor cover (blue circles).

### Lever is stuck

The end of the lever needs to be between the plastic parts of the sensor while the status is 0. Move the lever by hand and see if it moves easily. In case it does not move, loosen the middle screw (purple circle).

### Malfunctioning sensor

* When the lever is in the triggered position (pictured above), the status within _LCD menu - > Info -> Sensor info_ should be 0.
* When the lever is in the lowered position (when the filament is loaded), with the printed lever outside the IR sensor, the status within _LCD menu - > Info -> Sensor info_ should be 1.



If the status is either 0 or 1, regardless of the lever position, the sensor is malfunctioning.

You can test this by manually triggering the sensor with an Allen key or a black piece of filament, by inserting it between the plastic parts of the sensor (transparent filaments will not work for this).

# [USB not detected (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/usb-not-detected-mini-mini_230441)

The Original Prusa MINI uses USB flash storage to read G-codes during printing. It can happen that the USB drive is not recognized when inserted and the display will say "No USB", even when a USB is inserted. Since this issue can have several different causes and culprits, there is unfortunately not one universal way to fix it. **Here we will go through some of the steps to do and things to check to resolve this.**

### How it can appear

* **USB drive is not recognized at all.**
* **USB drive is not recognized when inserted but becomes visible after restarting the printer.**
* **USB drive is functional for printing, but firmware updating does not work.**



If the printer will detect the USB drive and can begin a print, but with eventual abnormal behavior it can indicate a faulty USB drive. However, **it is more likely the G-code itself is corrupted.** Try to export and copy the G-code to the USB drive again.

### Flash the firmware

If the USB drive is not recognized when inserted but becomes visible after restarting the printer, it is most likely a firmware issue. Handling of USB storage media is improved with each update.

If the USB stick only works for printing, but not for Flashing the firmware, please attempt the steps outlined below in this article, but you may need to use a different USB drive.

### Check the files and folder

#### Filenames

Some languages have **special characters or diacritics that cause issues** when attempting to read the drive. This has also [caused the Watchdog error](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/watchdog-reset-mini_134201) when attempting to print. Therefore, make sure you only use standard Latin letters in upper and lower-case. This is also why you will find that PrusaSlicer will autogenerate filenames with an underscore (_) instead of spaces. It is not always necessary, but to ensure backward and future compatibility, we recommend following these guidelines.

Filenames do not have a set maximum length of characters. However, they may not display correctly if they are very long. Therefore, make sure you do not make filenames unnecessarily long.

#### Folder structure

The same restrictions apply to the type and length of characters in folder names. Moreover, it is also good to know that **a folder tree can only be 10 folders deep** , _i.e USB/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/Folder4/Folder4/Folder6/Folder7/Folder8/Folder9/Folder10/_

#### File types

The printer will ignore files that it can not read. However, since the printer's firmware is updated using the USB drive, it can happen that you will have multiple firmware files on the drive at any given time. This can cause conflicts, so make sure you delete these and try to only have them present for the flashing process, then delete them.

### Corrupted USB drive

The easiest way to test this theory is to try with another (preferably new) USB drive, formatted to FAT32. **ExFAT is not compatible.** However, there are some procedures you can try with your current USB drive.

#### Repair the filesystem (keeps files)

The filesystem can become corrupted when you pull out the stick without unmounting/ejecting it. Most OSs have built-in features for "Recovery" or "Repair". There is also a range of third-party software with this functionality. However, the procedure brings few benefits, besides keeping your files and formatting, compared to if you reformat the drive. It is also a slower process.

#### Reformat to FAT32 (removes all data)

This will clear all the files on the disk and build the filesystem anew. **Only FAT32 is supported!** For drives over 32 GB, you will need a 3rd party application. For more information on formatting USB drives and SD cards, please see [SD cards and USB drives](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sd-cards-and-usb-drives_112291).

# [4. Firmware upgrading](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-firmware-upgrading_231265)

-  **This method requires a network connection**. Please, make sure that the printer is connected via Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

Starting with firmware 1.3.0, the printer performs automated checks for newer firmware files online and displays an on-screen message when a new update is found. Firmware 1.4.0 enables a manual firmware check via an on-screen button.

- On the touch screen navigate to: _Home - > Settings -> Firmware -> Download Now_. You will see the new Update is available. Click on it.

- On the screen with the new firmware version info and QR code scroll down and click on "Install".

- Wait until the whole process is completed. Upgrading the firmware can take a few minutes, depending on the speed of your internet connection.

- The printer restarts itself after the installation is complete.

---

# [6. First print](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-first-print_231273)

- After the print is finished, remove it from the print platform, wash and cure it. You can do it using the Curing and Washing machine (CW1S).

- Once the post-processing is finished, take a closer look at the model and visually inspect its design.

- If it's similar to the picture, it means that the print is complete, the model is not damaged, you have successfully upgraded your printer. **Congratulations!** :)

# [Original Prusa SL1 vs. SL1S Speed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/original-prusa-sl1-vs-sl1s-speed_233097)

With a brand new high-resolution monochrome LCD, larger print platform, and all cumulative updates from the entire lifespan of the SL1, the new SL1S SPEED is a lightning-fast machine that produces amazingly detailed 3D prints. In this article, we will go in-depth into the differences between these two variants, which on the surface look very similar, but underneath they are very different machines.

### New Hardware

#### Print Display

We replaced the 5,5’’ RGB print display with a larger monochromatic display (5,96’’). A monochrome LCD is excellent for SLA 3D printers because it offers vastly improved UV light transmission, which means shorter exposure times, better print quality, and faster printing. Monochromatic displays were unfortunately not readily available during the SL1's initial development and subsequent release but were the clear choice for the Original Prusa SL1S Speed. These displays are much more durable, lasting up to 4 times longer than an RGB display before it sees damage from UV light radiation (up to 2000 hours of printing!). This all accumulates to record-breaking print speeds which we have achieved with the SL1S Speed (down to 1.4 seconds per layer!). More on that later..

#### Print Platform

To accommodate the larger print display we also redesigned the print platform. This has led to a 25% larger build volume of 127×80×150 mm. That is an increase of 7 mm more on the X-axis and 12 mm on the Y-axis. Even though the previous "flat" design allowed for more resin to fit in the resin tank, we got many requests to add a chamfered top of the platform, allowing uncured resin to drip off more effectively.

### UV led module

With high-speed SLA printing, you need a strong and reliable UV LED source. The initial design of the LED panel with a V-reflector was reliable and strong enough but lacked the power to take print speed to the next level. Therefore, it has been replaced by a larger LED array which is 4 times as powerful and with a custom lens. We also got to use our [Prusament PC CF](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-pc-blend-carbon-fiber-black-800g-2/) as the LED/lens housing. This allowed for the intensity and uniformity of light needed to reach the record-breaking print speeds. This extra power not only makes printing standard 405 nm resin very fast but opens up for advanced materials which would otherwise not be possible due to substantially longer exposure times (more than 20 seconds per layer). Combined with a beefy heatsink and a new cooling solution, it is a durable and powerful upgrade to the machine. However, there was one more challenge to solve; how to supply enough power to utilize it.

#### Boost board

To power these new components we had to make some changes to the power delivery system. Using a more powerful _external_ PSU we made room to fit in a "Boost board". This board uses inductors and some clever logic to supply and accurately control an increased amount of current to the LED array module. Therefore, the UV LED module from the **initial SL1 is not compatible with the SL1S** , simply because they can't take the power provided.

#### Resin tank

While the initial resin tank was a beautiful piece of aluminum, it was both too small for the new platform and screen and also expensive to manufacture. The new tank is from high-quality graphite-reinforced PA6 (Nylon) composite which is injection molded and costs roughly a third of the old tank, with no drawbacks. It comes with a practical opaque lid, so the tanks are now stackable. The affordable price makes it an option to have several tanks and materials in active use, that you switch between. However, we recommend to empty and clean the tank after every print since tiny bits of cured resin might remain in the tank and can cause damage to the print display. Replacing the consumable FEP film in the tank is still easy and cheap, with no expensive proprietary components.

# [Print Profile (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/print-profile-sl1-sl1s_235270)

Starting firmware 1.6.0, we have included a **Print profile feature for more demanding geometry and materials** to ensure good results, considering the infinite range of these that the printer might see. For example, a hollow model, like a cup, can generate suction when separated from the FEP during fast layer changes.

Furthermore, special resins, like some flexible or casting resins, can have a much higher viscousity (thicker), and thus need more time to flow below the print platform between layer exposures. Therefore, **there are three speed options,** **'Faster', 'Slower' and 'High viscosity':**

* **Faster** \- The default profile for the SL1 and SL1S SPEED and would work for most projects.
* **Slower** \- Slows down tilt speed and introduces a pause before each exposure/layer.
* **High viscosity** \- Slows down the tilt speed and increases the pause between exposures even further than the 'Slower' profile.



_Project cracked due to suction during layer change._ _Same project printed with the "Slower" print setting._

Faster is always the default when starting a print.

### How to use it

Select the project you want to print from _Projects - > [project]_ and **swipe to the left to find 'Print Settings' and tap it ( purple arrow).**

Under Print Settings, you can adjust exposure durations and the ' _Print Profile_ ', found at the bottom (green square). _This setting can also be accessed during the print._

The option 'High Viscosity' was introduced with firmware version 1.7.0.

# [Creating a resin calibration object (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/creating-a-resin-calibration-object-sl1-sl1s_235292)

This guide will show you how to use your own model to generate a resin Calibration-object. **W** **e** **recommend this approach only to experienced users**. The [pre-made Resin calibration object](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/resin-calibration-sl1-sl1s_112182) should serve most user's needs, but there might be some specific models you are familiar with or that have features and geometry special to your application.

**Please note that for the Original Prusa SL1S SPEED**

this feature was completely overhauled and is currently available starting firmware 1.7.0-beta.4! This version is dedicated to experienced users. The final firmware will be released soon.

The .sl1/.sl1s-files for your Original Prusa resin printer is equivalent to the G-code for a FFF machine, but a little different. Files for the Original Prusa SL1 or SL1S SPEED (.sl1/.sl1s files) are archives like a zip-file, with a series of pictures (.png files) for each layer of the print, in addition to a configuration file (.ini file). After slicing, **the configuration file is mainly what you have to edit to create your calibration object. The printer will do the rest.**

### Selecting a model

#### Number and size

There are two main considerations when choosing a calibration object: The size of the object and the number of objects on the plate. The system will not know the size of your object so if you choose something too big, it can be cropped or not fit on the plate at all. You can test this by creating more instances and see how many will tile on the print platform (maximum 9). However, in the final project, you must only have one instance. The printer will generate the rest.

**You will find more information on size and orientation of an object at[the end of this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/creating-a-resin-calibration-object-sl1-sl1s_235292#how-objects-are-arranged).**

_Examples of how many instances will fit on the plate. In this case, 4 instances._

#### Geometry

We recommend a model with no extreme overhangs which require supports. This will save you a lot of time. Objects can fail completely, which you must then clean up before running the calibration again **.** Printer "stress tests" you should experiment with later. This is just to find the optimal exposure time across general geometries. This guide will use a version of the [Original Prusa SLA Test Object](https://www.printables.com/en/model/153659-original-prusa-sl1s-test-object), which is slightly modified to have a smaller footprint. It can be [downloaded from Printables.com](https://media.printables.com/media/prints/153267/stls/1442736_91040d79-8afb-4cb6-8e0c-78a6dd989c09/hexagon-sl1s.stl).

### Creating the project file

1. Open PrusaSlicer and select the printer you are calibrating for (SL1 or SL1S).
2. Add your model to PrusaSlicer and center it by using the [Auto-arrange tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/auto-arrange-tool_1770) (blue arrow). _**Only create one instance!**_


3. As Resin type select _Prusament Resin Tough Prusa Orange_ , at _0.05 Normal_ as SLA print setting (green square). _This is a good starting point for Tough resins._
4. Use no supports or pad (purple square).



If you are calibrating for another type of resin than Tough, i.e. Flexible or high-tenacity resin, it may be better to start with an existing preset for this type of resin. Exposure time can also be adjusted on the printer itself when you later start the print.

5. The printer will generate a label showing the exposure time. _This is always placed to the right of the model._ _You may have to rotate the model to make them all fit on the plate._
6. Slice and Export your SL1/SL1S project file.
7. Copy the exported file onto a USB drive or uploaded through PrusaLink to print the project.



### Modifying the project file

1. A program like [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) is open-source and will automatically recognize the project as an archive. Right-click the file and you are provided the option to "Extract" the content to a folder. _If you do not want 7zip installed, change the file name ending from ".sl1" to ".zip" and any archiving application will recognize it._



Make sure you have enabled showing file extensions in the file name. Under Windows 10 this is done by a check-box found under the View-tab in File Explorer.

2. You will now have a folder with a lot of images and two configuration files. You need to open edit "config.ini" in Notepad, Brackets, or any other plain-text editor. _Just ignore "PrusaSlicer.ini"._


3. After the last line ("usedMaterial = ***"), paste the three lines of code found below for your printer. _It is important that you use values compatible with your printer model (SL1 or SL1S SPEED) due to their very different average length of exposure._



**Explanation of parameters:**

*     *       * **calibrateRegions** represents the number of objects on the print plate. For this model, it is set to 4, due to the size of the object. You can change this but only use the numbers 2 4 6 8 9, depending on the size.
* **calibrateTime** is the time increment in seconds per object. Can be adjusted to 1 decimal place (0.1s)
* **calibratePadThickness** is the thickness in millimeters of the label generated for exposure time.
* **calibrateTextThickness** is the height in millimeters of the text on the label.



SL1SL1S SPEED


calibrateRegions = 4
calibrateTime = 1
calibratePadThickness = 1
calibrateTextThickness = 0.5


calibrateRegions = 4
calibrateTime = 0.1
calibratePadThickness = 1
calibrateTextThickness = 0.5

_Suggested values for a tough resin on each printer version._

4. Make sure you have the configuration as in the picture below and save (ctrl/cmd+S) the config.ini file and close your text editor.



_*Default configuration values._

5. Select all files in the folder (ctrl/cmd+a), right-click and create an archive (.zip file) of the content.



**Do not create the .zip file by simply right-clicking the folder.**

This will create an archive with a folder, not a series of files, which is incompatible.

6. Change the ending of this Zip file to " **.sl1** " or **".sl1s"** , depending on your printer model. Windows will warn you you may make the file unusable, and ask if you wish to continue. Click **Yes.**


7. Copy your newly made SL1 Resin Calibration object to a USB stick and you are ready to run the file on your printer.



### Starting the print

1. When selecting the project, swipe left to confirm your print settings.


2. Within Print settings, you can edit the values of some parameters you pasted in the previous steps. Verify they are as you need them and tap 'Back' in the top-left corner.



_Settings for SL1S SPEED. **These values will NOT be compatible with SL1.**_

3. Start your print and let it finish. You will see the printer has created more instances of the object and added a label stating the total layer exposure duration per instance.



_During printing, you can swipe right to see the mask of the current layer._

### Assessing the results

Assessing the results will depend on the geometry, but there are some general rules you can follow: The geometry **of prints will grow with exposure time**. In practice, this means that if you have missing details you must increase exposure duration. Vice versa, if elements, like thin holes, are filled completely you should reduce the exposure.

_An example of how geometry forms can be found in the[pre-made calibration object's glasses](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/resin-calibration-sl1-sl1s_112182), where the actual glass within the frame will not be printed if exposure duration is set too low._

This can be observed where different geometry meets/makes contact as well. Say you have two arrows pointing to each other, touching at the very tip; With insufficient exposure, the tips will not touch. Oppositely, with too long exposure, the point of contact will not be a single point, but rather the two arrow tips will slightly merge together.

### How objects are arranged

The printer will automatically take the unmasked area of the print and copy it as many times as is set in the config file (calibrateRegions). It is a basic copy/paste, following strict rules, meaning it will not rotate or arrange objects. With anything more than 2 objects it will place them in a grid pattern.

RegionsGrid sizeMax. X/Y object size SL1S SPEEDMax. X/Y object size SL1
42x263 mm x 40 mm60 mm x 34 mm
63x242 mm x 40 mm40 mm x 34 mm
84x231 mm x 40 mm30 mm x 34 mm
93x342 mm x 26 mm40 mm x 22 mm

_* Values are rounded down. Considerations for non-uniform/symmetric/extreme geometries must be applied. Note that for each object there is a tag (5x10 mm) connected to it. This affects the maximum object size._

#### If orientation or size is not right

With four regions it will always put them two by two. Therefore, the size and orientation of the model can affect whether everything will fit on the plate, or will be cropped by being outside of the platform.

It will not consider the total area of the object and place them all in a row, if that is how it would fit, like PrusaSlicer does.

### Creating a PrusaSlicer preset

**Did you find the best exposure time for your resin? Great!** You can start a normal print right away, adjusting the exposure time on the printer's display before the print or you can create your own resin profile:

1. **Open PrusaSlicer** and in the Plater view, select from the list of the printers (green arrow), Original Prusa SL1/SL1S SPEED, depending on which you have.
2. Select Prusament Resin Tough Prusa Orange as "SLA material" (orange arrow).
3. From SLA print settings (purple arrow), select the layer height you want to calibrate the resin for. This will load all the available resins.


1. Click on the **"Material settings"** tab on top.
2. Select any resin from the dropdown list with the layer height you intend to calibrate for. It will be used as a base for your new profile. Then click on the **"Save** " icon (?) next to the list (blue arrow).
3. A dialogue will open up where you **name the preset** (e.g. "My new calibrated resin") and hit "OK".
4. In the new resin, the profile **adjusts the fields "Initial Exposure time" and "Exposure time"** (red square), which sets the time for which each layer of the sliced object is exposed to the UV light.
5. Now, you are good to go. Slice your next model and Happy Printing!

# [How to replace the print display (SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-the-print-display-sl1s_235687)

**Proceed carefully with these screws**

, preferably use an Allen key with straight sharp edges, there is a risk of stripping the screw's head.

- Turn the left side of the printer towards you.

- Locate, release and remove the four screws.

- Turn the printer by 180° and remove the last four screws on the other side.

- Slide the cover just a few cm/inches out.

**There are two designs of USB and power button:**

-  **NEW DESIGN:** The USB and the power button share the same connector. Disconnect the cable and remove the cover completely.

-  **OLD DESIGN:** The USB and the power button are separate. Disconnect the power button cable from the extension cable and remove the cover completely.

# [Negative volume](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/negative-volume_238503)

The negative volume lets you subtract one mesh from another.

That way you can, for example, create easily resizable holes directly in PrusaSlicer.

**Right-click** on a model and pick **Negative volume** from the context menu. Then select the negative volume shape. You can either pick one of the basic shapes (cube, cylinder, sphere), pick one from the Shapes Gallery or use **Load...** to import a custom mesh.

The subtraction of the negative volume happens during slicing, the actual model geometry is not modified. That means it is not possible to export an STL with the subtracted negative volumes.

---

# [Simplify mesh](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simplify-mesh_238941)

3D scans and sculpted models often have a huge number of triangles, making them difficult to work with. These files can slow PrusaSlicer down, take a very long time to slice and even slow down FDM 3d printers, due to the huge number of short toolpaths generated.

You can reduce the number of triangles in a mesh using the Simplify mesh feature. Right-click the model and pick **Simplify model** from the context menu.

You can limit the simplification either by detail level or by the ratio of triangles to remove.

You can also enable the "Show wireframe" option to see white outlines of individual triangles.

A very high simplification rate (small number of triangles) may be used to achieve a "

**Low-Poly**

" effect.

A preview automatically starts being generated whenever you adjust the position of either slider. Once the simplification finishes, the simplified mesh will be displayed.

Clicking the **Apply** button uses the current settings for the simplification process and closes the dialog. You can revert this action with the Undo function (Ctrl+Z).

The simplification of models with a huge number of triangles is computationally intensive and **will take some time** , especially on slower machines.

# [How to lift object from the print bed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-lift-object-from-the-print-bed_245192)

By default, PrusaSlicer places the bottom-most point of each object on the build plate.

In the vast majority of cases, this saves the user time and prevents possible failed prints, where the model would be accidentally slightly lifted above the print bed. However, in some cases, you might want to lift an object above the print bed on purpose. For example, you might want to add a logo or text on top of another object.

The way to do it currently is to use a **multi-part object**. Only the bottom-most part of a multi-part object will be placed on the build plate. Other parts can be lifted from the build plate freely.

### Load the "levitating" object as a part

1. **Right-click** an existing object in the 3D View
2. Select **Add part - Load object..** (or select any of the basic primitives from the list)
3. Select the [**Move** **tool**](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/move-rotate-scale-tools_1914) from the left menu
4. Move the part wherever you want it (or use the [Object manipulation panel](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/object-manipulation-panel_1757) to enter precise values)



### Merge multiple objects

You can also create a multi-part object by merging multiple objects together

1. Select multiple objects (Use box selection or Ctrl+left mouse button click to add an object to current selection)
2. **Right-click** any of the models
3. Select **Merge**
4. Select individual part using the Object list
5. Select the **[Move tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/move-rotate-scale-tools_1914)** from the left menu
6. Move the part wherever you want it (or use the [Object manipulation panel](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/object-manipulation-panel_1757) to enter precise values)



#### Selecting individual parts

When you click on a multi-part object in the 3D view, all parts will be selected. Use the [Object list](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/object-list_1758) in the right panel to select individual parts.

### Why don't we simply allow lifting objects up?

Contrary to other slicers, PrusaSlicer slices each object independently and it also builds supports for each object independently. This approach is beneficial in many ways, it allows us to do tricks like variable layer height, support stepping independently per object or reslicing only part of the scene when a parameter changes to save time. On the other hand, it also means that objects, and more importantly, supports from two separate objects can collide. Placing one object on top of another and enabling supports would counterintuitively build supports through the bottom object, which would be difficult to see in the preview and ruin the print. Indeed, intersecting supports for objects placed close together is relatively frequently reported as a bug even now.

In addition, the assumption "objects are not floating" is present in many places of the codebase, and there is no simple way to simply allow lifting objects up without breaking many of the existing features.

To summarize, in order to enable this in the future, we will also have to implement:

1. Collision detection on the plater. We already have the infrastructure in PrusaSlicer for that.
2. Collision of supports from different objects.



With that, the user will get meaningful feedback if the print is not printable (floating in mid-air or having overlapping extrusions) Implementing all of this will be fairly difficult. With some more requested tasks from the community having a higher priority for us, we have no estimated deadline for implementing this.

# [Dump memory (MK3/S/+ and MK2.5/S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/dump-memory-mk3-s-and-mk2-5-s_245237)

The memory dump is not used for troubleshooting normal printer errors! Please only supply the Memory dump if requested.

Starting from firmware version 3.10.1, the Original Prusa MK3/S/+ and MK2.5/S have the option of Dump Memory, which will store the RAM content in the xFlash memory. This can be used for diagnosing unusual system issues.

The Memory dump has important information about your printers, like the serial number and IP address. Sharing this data publicly is not recommended.

### MK3, MK3S, and MK3S+

To access the feature, go to _LCD menu - > Support -> Dump memory_. This can be used at any time, even during printing.

Note that the printer will stop for the snapshot and it will take some time to finish, therefore we advise you not to use this feature if you are not experiencing any problems.

The only way to correctly get the saved dump from the printer is by connecting the printer using PuTTY or OctoPrint in the same way as the [Crash dump](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/crash-dump_364959).

Please be aware not to connect the serial link during print as it can restart the printer and break the recent printing job.

The Dump memory to xFlash is active at any time, it is stored in xFlash and can be downloaded even after the system reboot. It will be deleted when a new


D22

command is sent to the printer.

### MK2.5, MK2.5S

Since the MK2.5 series does not contain the xFlash, the dump memory cannot be stored, so it needs to be sent to a serial link connection. In order to get the memory dump from the printer, there must be a serial link connection available prior to any dump download. In default, the _LCD Menu - > Support -> Dump to serial_ and crash dump are disabled after the printer restart.

To get the dump the following process has to be followed and serial commands used:

1. Connect the serial link to Printer. As the serial link connection restarts the Printer, it has to be done before any further activity.
2. Using the

D23

command from the serial link enables the crash dump by setting the crash dump flag and activates the _LCD Menu - > Support-> Dump to serial_ display menu.
3.     D23 R

command disables the crash dump and removes the _LCD Menu - > Support-> Dump to serial_ display menu.
4. The command D23 E - sends the Dump down to the serial link immediately and resets the printer.
5. Command

D20

,

D21

,

D22

are ignored.
6. The Dump to serial command should be available even during print and should be found again under LCD Menu -> Support-> Dump to serial display menu.



In case any strange characters appear on the screen, press the reset button below the LCD knob.

# [Fuzzy skin](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fuzzy-skin_246186)

Fuzzy skin is only available in PrusaSlicer 2.4 and newer versions.

Some options will not appear when PrusaSlicer is in

[Simple mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

.

The **Fuzzy skin** feature lets you create a rough fiber-like texture on the sides of your models. If enabled, the perimeter will be resampled with a random step size and each new sample point will be shifted inside or outside of the perimeter by a random length limited by the Fuzzy skin thickness. This simple algorithm produces surprisingly nice results suitable for tool handles or just to give the print surface a new interesting look or to hide print imprecisions. You can also use modifiers to apply fuzzy skin only to a portion of your model.

You'll find Fuzzy skin settings in **Print settings - Layers and perimeters**.

### Fuzzy skin type

You can select to apply Fuzzy skin only to **External perimeters** or to **All perimeters**.

_Fuzzy skin type set to External perimeters (left), All perimeters (right)_

### Fuzzy skin thickness

The maximum distance that each skin point can be offset (both ways) is measured perpendicular to the perimeter wall.

_Fuzzy skin thickness 0.1 mm (left), 0.3 mm (right)_

### Fuzzy skin point distance

Perimeters will be split into multiple segments by inserting Fuzzy skin points. Lowering the Fuzzy skin point distance will increase the number of randomly offset points on the perimeter wall.

_Fuzzy skin point distance 0.5 mm (left), 1.0 mm (right)_

### Fuzzy skin modifier

You can use modifiers to apply fuzzy skin only to a portion of your model.

1. **Right-click** a model and pick **Add modifier** \- [Select modifier type].
2. Position the modifier so that it overlaps with your model
3. **Right-click** the modifier and choose **Add settings - Fuzzy Skin**
4. In the pop-up window, select which settings you wish to modify
5. Change **Fuzzy skin** to **External perimeters** or **All Perimeters**
6. Optionally, you can edit other Fuzzy Skin settings as well

# [Filament failed to unload (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-failed-to-unload-mini-mini_256870)

When unloading the filament, the tip can have a large or irregular shape that is too big for the Bowden PTFE tube. You may hear some grinding sounds from the extruder as the printer is unable to pull the filament. It can then be stuck in the Bowden or hotend PTFE tube after the unloading procedure is complete.

**To resolve this in the fastest way possible** your approach can differ depending on where it is stuck:

* **Inside print head:** The tip filament is not visible, stuck _before_ the Bowden tube (green arrows).
* **Inside Bowden:** The tip of the filament is visible and stuck in the Bowden PTFE tube (blue arrows).



_Inside print head - Stuck anywhere below the fitting_ _Inside Bowden - Stuck anywhere in the Bowden tube_

### Stuck inside print head

1. Make sure the nozzle is still heated to the temperature of the loaded filament. If the nozzle is cold, navigate to _LCD menu - > Settings -> Temperatures -> Nozzles_, and set the correct temperature.



CAUTION: The nozzle is now hot and can cause burns!

2. Unscrew the large brass nut (purple arrow) securing the long PTFE tube, using pliers or a 10 mm spanner. _The lower portion of the brass fitting should **not** be unscrewed nor removed!_


3. Pull out the filament from the hotend PTFE tube. _You may need to use pliers and there can be some resistance._


4. Cut the irregularly shaped filament tip obstructing the unload, at a 45-degree angle.


5. Repeat the unload filament function to completely unload the filament.
6. Resecure the brass fitting and you should be ready to load a new filament.



### Stuck inside Bowden

1. Unscrew the large brass nuts (green and purple arrows) on both sides of the Bowden PTFE tube by using pliers or a 10 mm spanner (blue arrow). _The lower portion of either brass fittings should **not** be unscrewed and removed!_


2. On the extruder, secure the filament with a pair of pliers while pulling the PTFE tube off the filament using your other hand. _You can expect an amount of resistance as the filament tip goes through the last bit of the PTFE tube_.

3. Cut the irregularly shaped filament tip obstructing the unload at a 45-degree angle.
4. Repeat the unload filament function to completely unload the filament.
5. Resecure both of the brass fittings and you should be ready to load a new filament.



### After it is resolved

If you experience several failed unloads, the extruder's pulley gear (left picture) may have filament dust and debris in its teeth that need to be cleaned. Please see [How to access and clean the extruder-pulley (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-access-and-clean-the-extruder-pulley-mini-mini_126457) for detailed steps. Furthermore, make sure the idler screw is roughly flush with the plastic (right picture).

# [Dark mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/dark-mode_258977)

### OSX and Linux

PrusaSlicer supports dark mode on OSX and Linux natively. If you have dark mode enabled in your system settings, PrusaSlicer should automatically start in dark mode as well.

### Windows

You can enable dark-mode manually from **Preferences - GUI - Use dark color mode (experimental)**.

Implementing dark mode for Windows took significantly more effort than we expected. Unlike OSX and Linux, Windows has no official dark mode for Win32 controls, which our multi-platform GUI library (wxWidgets) uses. So we embarked on a journey to implement it ourselves. We started skinning the existing Win32 components and implementing replacements for those, which were not skinnable. Luckily, we discovered Notepad++! As far as we’re aware, Notepad++ is the only Win32 open-source application that implements Dark Mode to a reasonable extent. We ended up using some of the source code from Notepad++ interfacing with the unpublished Dark Mode API, which is based on this project.

# [Multi material painting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multi-material-painting_262620)

Preparing models for multi-material FDM prints used to be a fairly complicated and time-consuming process. Starting with PrusaSlicer 2.4, coloring an object for multi-material printing requires just a handful of bucket fills and brushstroke operations.

Similar to the support or seam painting tool. Hold down your left-mouse button to paint with the primary color, the right mouse button to paint with the secondary color.

With the Smart fill tool selected, as you hover the mouse above the model, you get a real-time preview of the automatically detected region to paint. The paint fills a region below the mouse cursor up to a sharp edge, with the threshold angle adjustable.

Replace a patch of one color with another.

### Color selection

The combo boxes **First color** and **Second color** in the panel allow mapping different extruders to the left and right mouse buttons. The number and color of the selected extruder are shown for clarity. The color that is used for visualization can be overridden by clicking the colored square next to the selected extruder. This visualization color is not saved anywhere and will be lost when the application closes.

### Segmenting colors

During slicing, the painted regions are cleverly extended inwards, giving the different colors/polymers the best chance of binding together.

The object surface is segmented into patches of the same material and the patches are extended inwards. The regions painted at the top resp. bottom surfaces are extended by the number of top_solid_layers resp. bottom_solid_layers (configurable in Print Settings - Layers and Perimeters). The regions painted at the side walls are expanded inwards up to maximum mmu_segmented_region_max_width (which is a new configuration parameter accessible in Print Settings->Multiple Extruders->Advanced).

The painting only affects the slicing result, the model itself is not altered and the colored "parts" cannot be exported separately.

### Notes

Please note that thin features are not printable with FDM technology, thus for example painting a thin wall with two distinct colors will not make the thin wall printable. Such thin non-printable regions created during segmentation are thus detected and merged with the neighboring region, changing its color. PrusaSlicer will print thinner features with "detect thin walls" enabled, thus it is advised to try to enable "detect thin walls" if painting over thin features.

There are two extra limitations arising from technical reasons:

The multi-material painting is limited to 16 extruders. If your printer uses more extruders, only the first 16 will be available in the painting tool.

Multi-material painting cannot be combined with XY size compensation. The XY size compensation will be ignored during slicing if the object is also multi-material painted. The user is informed by notification in both cases.

### Examples of painted models

# [Vibration/noise when printing (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/vibration-noise-when-printing-mini-mini_264110)

Your Original Prusa MINI and MINI+ printer may be causing some vibrations during use. In most cases, this will not cause any printing issues, however, we will show you how to minimize it or get rid of it entirely.

### Identify the noise

Go to the _Printer display - > Settings -> Move Axis,_ and _Move X_ and _Move Y_ individually to see if the noise can be narrowed down to a single axis. You can also start a print and during operation/noise, try placing your hand on various components and hear if it dampens the sound.

* Heatbed
* Motors
* LCD assembly



Some sounds can be hard to identify and some may only present themselves with certain simultaneous movements of the X- and Y-axis. Therefore, we recommend inspecting all points outlined in this article, even if you are not sure exactly where the noise is coming from.

### Inspect your printer

#### Foam pads

The printer comes with 5 foam pads that should be placed in the correct positions. There are 4 onto the ends of the frame's aluminium extrusions (green arrows), and a 5th below the electronics box in a space reserved for it (purple arrow).

Make sure the pads are on the frame extrusions, not the front- and back-plate.

#### Lubricating rods and bearings

New noises coming from the printer after many hours of use is likely a sign that the rods and bearings could use some attention. For more information on how and with what to lubricate [check out our guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/maintenance-tips_23200).

#### X-axis

Look at the X-axis from the side. Align the X-end parallel to the Z-axis smooth rods by twisting the plastic part. Do not use too much force when twisting. You may damage the X-axis. You can use the steel sheet to check the rods against the heatbed.

#### Y-axis

Make sure that both the front and rear plates are well secured. Go over each screw with a 3 mm Allen key. When tightening the M5x20r screws, push on the extrusion from above.

#### Heatbed screws

Check the 9 screws on the heatbed if any might be loose. If these are not well secured, the heatbed, screws, and spacers can rattle during movements. When tightening, always follow the correct order of:

1. The center screw (light blue circles)
2. The four edges (purple circles)
3. The remaining four corners (yellow circles)



#### Y-axis pulley

If the pulley Y-axis is touching the motor, even just slightly, it adds resistance which can lead to vibrations and even printing issues. Ensure that the spacing is the correct 2 millimeters, the pulley is oriented correctly, and secured by the set screw on the flat side of the motor shaft (purple arrow).

### Other tips and tricks

#### Surface the printer stands on

The surface that the printer is on can amplify any of the vibrations and noises coming from the printer. **The surface the printer is on should be steady and firm, and should not wobble during printing or if pushed by hand.** A hardwood table is an example of this.

This can be enhanced further by placing the printer on a concrete slab/tile which would eliminate any vibrations traveling into the table/desk the printer is standing on.

#### Padding under the printer

An easy solution to dampening the noise and vibration of your printer is to add some sort of additional padding underneath the printer. This will dampen any sound resulting from the resonance between the
printer and the surface the printer is resting on.

Due to the different construction of the Original Prusa MINI,

**very soft padding is not optimal**

as the printer can wobble during operation.

You can use something you have around the house. Such as a folded towel or foam padding like you may find in children's play areas.

# [Experimental menu (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/experimental-menu-mini-mini_264396)

The components installed on your printer rely on firmware configuration. To facilitate for components sourced from third-party vendors **firmware version 4.3.3 introduced an "Experimental menu"**. Because different hardware has different specifications, the firmware is now capable of adjusting the defining parameters of some components.

**The experimental menu is for advanced users.**

For a printer with stock parts, you should not make any changes to these firmware parameters! It can cause bad performance or even damage the printer and its parts.

To activate the experimental menu, navigate to _LCD menu - > Settings_ and scroll down to _HW Setup_ **without selecting it with a short-press** (left picture). Instead, **Hold the knob for 2-3 seconds** and after a “click” sound, the Experimental menu will appear (right picture).

_Long-press this option._ _After holding 2-3 seconds this menu will appear._

**Save and return:** Saves the current values and returns to the previous screen.

* **Z-axis length:** In this menu, the Z-axis length can be adjusted according to the size of your extruder.
* **Default Z-length:** resets the Z-axis length to default/stock.
* **Extruder step:** set the steps appropriate for your extruder.
* **Default steps per unit:** resets Extruder steps to default/stock.
* **Extruder direction:** shows two options of the extruder motor direction. Default/stock is "Prusa", and the other is "Wrong".
* **Default directions:** resets extruder direction to default/stock.



#### Save and return

After the correct settings are changed, select **Save and return**. The printer will ask you whether you want to save the changes and reboot the printer. On reboot, your printer will have the new settings for your custom extruder. This will ensure, that even with adjusted parameters the printer will be still able to perform First Layer Calibration, Live Adjust Z and, of course, print.

Adjusting settings in the experimental menu is at the owner's risk. Prusa Research takes no responsibility for the possible issues or damage to the printer. However, we are ready to help you bringing the printer back to the factory setup.

# [How to replace UV LED assembly (SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-uv-led-assembly-sl1s_264599)

- Close the lid, plug in the printer and turn it ON.

- Go to Menu -> Settings -> Calibration -> Display test and follow the instructions on the display.

**Don't open the lid, keep it closed!**

There is a UV light inside, which may cause a damage to your eyes.

- Look from the front side into the printer. Your eye level needs to be above the display. Otherwise, you won't be able to judge the result correctly.

- Check the entire screen, the whole area must be lit evenly and you must be able to see the details of our company logo across the whole screen. No parts (letters) should be missing.

Tip: If you can't see the logo clearly, try placing a sheet of paper onto the screen. We recommend the A5 format with a density up to 80g/m².

Don't forget to CLOSE THE COVER after inserting the sheet!

# [UPS backup for your printer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ups-backup-for-your-printer_266023)

If the printer is being used in an area where the power grid has issues constantly, you might wish to install a _UPS_ (Uninterruptible Power Supply) with the printer. UPS can compensate for power surges, voltage fluctuations, and temporary power loss.

Some considerations need to be made when purchasing the UPS.

### Power panic _(selected models only)_

The Original Prusa MK4, MK3.9, MK3.5, MK3S+ and XL printers are equipped with a [Power Panic](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/power-panic_2092) feature, which recovers the print when the energy is back after a power outage. If power outages are constant, make sure to test the [Power panic](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/testing-safety-features-mk3-mk3s_2079#power-panic).

The power panic will work over multiple power outages, even if the printer is not re-started.

### Choosing a UPS for your printer

If using a UPS is necessary, it is recommended to use a UPS that uses Line interactive technology. A Standby UPS will cause the printer to restart due to the higher triggering time.

A UPS is chosen based on the apparent power (VA) needed for the system. It is not recommended to use UPS smaller than 1000 VA for the printer.

Note that a UPS will not run your printer for a long amount of time. If a power outage lasts a long time, it is recommended to safely turn off the printer and start the print again after the power is back. For the printers with no Power Panic, the print will have to be started from the beginning.

### How long will the UPS power my printer?

We have tested each printer using a Line interactive 1500 VA UPS. See below the information from each printer.

# [Factory repair](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-repair_267131)

If your printer has an issue you cannot solve by troubleshooting remotely with our [Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287), it is possible to send the printer to be repaired by one of our technicians.

### Repair within warranty

If you have a **pre-assembled** printer, the cost of sending the printer for repair is covered by your warranty.

If you have a **kit** version of the printer, only the individual parts are covered by the warranty, not the repair. If you wish to send the printer for repair, the shipping and service will be charged even within the warranty.

**You can read more about the warranty claims here:[Warranty](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/warranty_2288).**

Note that if a user error is found during the warranty repair, the parts and return shipping will be charged!

### Repair out of warranty

If your printer was purchased as a kit or you have an assembled printer out of warranty, you may wish for a repair at our facility. Start by contacting our [Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) with details of the issue.

### Procedure

When a repair service is requested, an email will be sent within a few days with instructions for the return process. A [Service list](https://www.prusa3d.com/downloads/others/PrusaServiceList_EN.pdf) must be filled by the user of the printer with the report of the issue.

When the printer is received it will be evaluated, and an initial diagnostic will be made on the hardware, function of the printer, and the Service list. The cost of repair will be estimated based on what was found in the initial evaluation.

### Price

Not applicable to pre-assembled printers within warranty.

**You will not be charged anything else on top of the estimated cost of the repair.** This estimate may only change with an additional request from your side (modification/upgrade of the printer) and must be approved by both the customer and the service technician.

The total cost of the repair will be:
Shipping both ways + Technician's time + Parts to be changed.

* **The shipping cost is based on your address.** If you want to know the price, go to our e-shop and add the pre-assembled version of your printer to the cart along with your address. This will show the shipping one way, and the total shipping to be paid will be twice that amount. If you want us to use a specific carrier or use your own carrier, this must be specified when requesting the repair. When using your own carrier, any damage during shipping will be your responsibility.
* **The technician's time is charged by the hour.** Once the scope of the repair is known, the technician will provide you with a time estimate including the expected price. This value can be charged in any of the currencies available the [e-shop](https://shop.prusa3d.com/) (CZK, USD, EUR, PLN, and GBP).
* **The parts have our retail prices** and will be listed in the price estimate.



A "reserve amount" will be added to the price estimate. This amount is calculated based on the total repair cost. It will cover the technician's time and parts in case of undisclosed issues or in case the printer has any third-party modifications. If nothing is found, this value is not added to the final amount.

**The repair will only commence after the costs are accepted.** In case you do not accept the repair costs, the printer will be shipped back as-is. In this case, the shipping fees of the return will be charged. After payment, the printer is shipped back without being repaired.

### Repair

The printer will be repaired by our service team, and a sequence of prints will be made to test all the printer features. This includes any specific G-codes that you have issues with (if these are added to the SD card and **mentioned in the service list** ), plus test prints of the printer's main features.

If you want defect/replaced parts shipped back to you with the repaired printer, be sure to specify this on the

[Service list](https://www.prusa3d.com/downloads/others/PrusaServiceList_EN.pdf)

. However, this can impact the shipping cost.

After the printer is received, **the repair can take up to 30 days (according to EU law)**. However, this is only the worst-case scenario and we're usually able to process the standard repair requests in a shorter time. You can request a time estimate after the initial evaluation.

After the repair, the payment is made. The printer will be shipped back to you, along with the test prints and a final repair protocol detailing what was repaired or changed _._

### Repair warranty

**The specific part of the printer that is repaired has three months warranty** (repair contract). If the reported issue(s) of the repaired printer is still present upon return, or there are flaws due to poor workmanship or negligence by our service technicians, the printer can be returned for service again free of charge **within these three months.**

However, the **Repair Contract warranty is unrelated to the printer's general warranty.** Furthermore, if another/new issue appears, unrelated to the repaired part, it is not covered under this three-month repair warranty. A new estimated cost of the repair will have to be prepared and confirmed.

# [Temp not matching print head #12210 (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/temp-not-matching-print-head-12210-mini-mini_268968)

### What happened?

The printer displays the message **"Temp not matching - Measured temperature is not matching expected value. Check the thermistor is in contact with hotend. In case of damage, replace it."** when the measured temperature is different from the temperature expected temperature for the hotend.

This can happen if any thermistor failure on the hotend causes the printer to read the temperature within 6 ºC of the target temperature, but not the target temperature itself. The heater will keep trying to heat up while the target temperature is not reached. To prevent overheating the printer generates the error.

### How to fix it?

The error might indicate some issue with the wiring, either the heater or the thermistor cables are possibly damaged.

#### Room temperature

Check if the room where the printer is does not have a temperature below 15 ºC.

#### A visual inspection

Check on the hotend, where the thermistor (purple arrow) and heater (green arrow) reside, that no wires have broken off the sensor or heater themselves. While the printer is turned off, carefully try to move the wires by hand. If any of them have come detached your search is over and the part needs to be changed. **It is not recommended to solder these wires,** moreover, for the thermistor, it will change its resistance and thus readings. Spare parts can be found in our e-shop, or you can contact [Support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) for assistance.

Try preheating the hotend in _LCD-menu - > Settings -> Temperatures -> Nozzle_ to 250 ºC. After the temperature is reached, move the cables behind the print head by hand to see if the error will appear. In case the LCD main screen shows 0/0 in the hotend temperature, check the cable connections to the Buddy board.

Loosen the one screw securing the cover (circled in the picture below) and flip it open to reveal the board.

Check that all the connectors are secure in their sockets, according to the picture below. Focus on the thermistor and heater cables (blue for the print head). Though unlikely, rough shipping or handling could have shaken the heater or thermistor cables loose.

#### Checking the resistance

The table below describes the correct resistance for each part, as well as what scale you should set your meter to. **We have another more in-depth guide on[Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117).** All thermistors are rated to be **100 kΩ at 25 °C.** To be realistic, with a varying temperature between 20 °C and 30 **°** C, **you can expect a wider range of readings (~85-125 kΩ) than with the heater.**

There can be micro-fractures in the cable, breaking the connections only at certain positions. Therefore, try to move the cable a bit while doing the measurement and see if the value changes drastically.

##### Part

##### Resistance

##### Multimeter scale

Thermistors (Bed and hotend)

Hotend heater

**The part should be cold (room temperature) and unplugged when measuring the resistance!**

#### Where to measure

For every component, there are several options, our main focus will be on the connectors. The measurement appears on the multimeter LCD as soon as the measurement probes touch the component. To obtain the correct and relevant values, this is where you need to apply the probes:

* **Thermistors:** metal inserts in plastic connectors


* **Heater cables:** screws holding the cables in the connector

# [Post-processing scripts](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/post-processing-scripts_283913)

There are some things that PrusaSlicer simply doesn’t do. However, using post-processing scripts you can automatically modify the generated G-code to do (almost) anything you want.

You can specify the path to the script in **Print settings - Output options - Post-processing scripts**.

### Script setup

Post-processing scripts can be written in **any programming language** (Perl, Python, Ruby, Bash etc.). They just need to be recognized by your system as an executable and accept the path to the G-code file as the only argument.

If you want to run several scripts, put each script invocation into its own line.

### Script execution

Each script will be passed the absolute path of a **temporary** G-code file that PrusaSlicer generates. This file is stored in a temporary folder on your drive (typically your fast system drive). The script is then executed to modify the G-code in place and the resulting G-code file is written to your selected target folder or sent to a print host, such as PrusaConnect or Octoprint.

Please note that the G-code viewer still visualizes G-code before post-processing.

PrusaSlicer passes all the slicing configuration to post processing scripts using the environment variables. Each variable is prefixed with "SLIC3R_" and the first variable name is capitalized. For example, the infill density is passed to the script as an environment variable "SLIC3R_Fill_density".

Two additional environment variables are passed to post processing scripts: The environment variable SLIC3R_PP_HOST provides the host specification, where "File" means copying the G-code to a local hard drive or removable media, while the other values ("PrusaLink", "Repetier", "SL1Host", "OctoPrint", "FlashAir", "Duet", "AstroBox" ...) specify the print host type the G-code will be sent to.

The environment variable SLIC3R_PP_OUTPUT_NAME contains the name of the G-code file including path (for SLIC3R_PP_HOST == "File") or a name that will be given to the file after it is uploaded to the host (PrusaLink, Octoprint ...)

The post-processing script may suggest a new output file name (likely based on SLIC3R_PP_OUTPUT_NAME) by saving it as a single line into a new "output name" temp file, for example to add time stamps or sequence numbers to the final G-codes.The "output name" file name is to be created by suffixing the input G-code file name with ".output_name". PrusaSlicer will read the new name of the file and handle it properly, for example, when sending it to Octoprint.

### Script Parameters

You can use parameters with your script as such:

/path/to/executable becomes /path/to/executable with the arg outputfilename.gcode

/path/to/executable -arg -arg2 becomes /path/to/executable with args -arg, -arg2, and outputfilename.gcode

If path to executable or arguments contain spaces, these arguments need to be escaped using the escaping style common to the platform (shell escaping style on Linux and OSX, Windows command line escaping).

### Examples

#### Python

[Adding counter to the file name example](https://github.com/foreachthing/Slic3rPostProcessing/blob/a47d64c8b83459cf3bd2906a3e81172c07328f34/SPP-Python/Slic3rPostProcessor.py#L212)

Path to the final exported file (or its name for Octoprint)


env_slicer_pp_output_name = str(getenv('SLIC3R_PP_OUTPUT_NAME'))

Python script that modifies the output path


with open(sourcefile + '.output_name', mode='w', encoding='UTF-8') as fopen:
fopen.write(counter + '_' + env_slicer_pp_output_name)

### Historical changes and breaking backward compatibility

Before version 2.4, PrusaSlicer used to execute the script on the final G-code exported to your desired target medium. Which was very often a removable drive, such as an SD card. SD cards are slow and wear out, so this was not ideal. There were also problems when sending the G-code to Octoprint. The new approach with the temporary file on your system drive prevents these problems and extends the functionality of post-processing scripts. However, it might break some of your existing scripts.

This documentation page includes some texts from the [original Slic3r documentation](https://manual.slic3r.org/advanced/post-processing) and from [Bob's Project Notebook](https://projects.ttlexceeded.com/3dprinting_prusaslicer_post-processing.html).

# [Stuck Recovery (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/stuck-recovery-sl1-sl1s_296828)

If the tilt platform is unable to tear away from the FEP foil during printing, this error will be presented. The printer will notice the increase current required to move the tilt platform and pause the print. This will most often happen within the first 10 layers.

This error can occur with certain resin, like flexible resins, which adheres strongly to both platform and the FEP film. Furthermore, projects with a very large surface area can be problematic, especially when being printed too fast and/or the tilt platform is calibrated too close to the print platform by the user.

_Cross-section of a project covering the whole length (Y-axis) of the print platform, printing with flexible resin._

### How to fix it

* First, try to continue while observing the printer. However, the current print may not be possible to salvage.
* Try using the "Slower" speed profile. Please see [Print Profile (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/print-profile-sl1-sl1s_235270).
* See if you can slice your model in a different orientation, leaving a smaller footprint on the platform and FEP foil.

# [Shape Gallery](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/shape-gallery_301453)

The built-in shape gallery provides a quick and easy way to access your most used models, whether you use them as modifiers or to be placed on the platter and printed. The default shapes include basic primitives (cube, cylinder, sphere…) as well as other useful objects, such as a helper disk or a recycling symbol. You can expand the library with your own models. This could be your company logo, a modifier shape that you use often, or just a model you print over and over again. If you add a model, it will get an automatically generated thumbnail. However, you can replace the generated PNG thumbnail with your own image.

We plan to expand the shape gallery functionality in future releases. We’ll likely add a folder/tab system, so you can organize the shapes. We’re also planning to add a text generator. And we’ll expand the library of the default shapes. If you have a suggestion for a model that should be included by default, let us know!

# [Tip Of The Day Notifications](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tip-of-the-day-notifications_301465)

PrusaSlicer grows more powerful every day. Offering many unique features not found in other slicers. The downside of adding new features is the ever-increasing complexity of the program. To make new features easier to discover, we implemented special notifications with helpful tips.

Every time you launch PrusaSlicer, one hint notification is displayed, presented by our trusty [Clippy Jo](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/75254-prusa-clippy-statue-no-need-mmu).

We did our best to fill the tips with **actual useful information** and **little-known features** , described in **short** , digestible bits.

Some “Did you know” hints provide a hyperlink to highlight a user interface element (toolbar button, configuration parameter) or open the documentation in a web browser.

You can disable “Did you know” notifications in preferences.

# [Slicing mode / 3DLabPrint airplanes](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/slicing-mode-3dlabprint-airplanes_301501)

Some options will not appear when PrusaSlicer is in

[Simple mode](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/simple-advanced-expert-modes_1765)

.

### Slicing mode

###

#### Regular

The default behavior uses the [Positive fill rule](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper/documentation/Docs/Units/ClipperLib/Types/PolyFillType.htm).

#### Even-odd - 3DLabPrint airplane models

PrusaSlicer supports the slicing of [3DLabPrint airplane models](https://3dlabprint.com/). These 3DLabPrint models were designed to be sliced with Simplify3D with a single perimeter and no infill to produce a lightweight wing reinforced by single perimeter ribs. From the solid geometry point of view, these models contain overlapping bodies and are not valid solid models. But because the models were designed specifically for Simplify3D and the way it evaluates such objects, the exported G-code was correct. To allow slicing the 3DLabPrint models, PrusaSlicer implements a new “Slicing Mode” option, allowing one to switch between the “Positive” (default) and “Even / Odd” fill rule.

**Use the “Even / Odd” option to slice 3DLabPrint airplanes correctly.** Check out [the 3DLabPrint PrusaSlicer tutorial](https://3dlabprint.com/faq/prusaslicer/) for more information about how to slice their models.

# [G-code substitutions](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/g-code-substitutions_301694)

This feature will be available in PrusaSlicer 2.4.1

PrusaSlicer offers simple G-Code post-processing by specifying find and replace pairs, with optional regex matching, case sensitivity and whole word matching, similar to what common text editors offer. Regular expressions are very powerful and versatile tool that allows to set up even quite complicated substitutions. If you need more complicated post-processing, it is possible to use an [external post-processing script](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/post-processing-scripts_283913) instead.

The feature accessible from **Print Settings - > Output options**.

The G-Code is processed before it is previewed, so your changes will be visible in the G-Code preview. It may be helpful to turn on 'Verbose G-Code' to make PrusaSlicer generate extra annotations, which you can then match with a regex.

### Regular expression syntax

Regular expression syntax of Perl is supported as described in [boost Perl regular expression syntax](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_78_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/syntax/perl_syntax.html), where a "single line" modifier mimics the Perl's **_s/_** modifier. With regular expressions active, the "Replace with" pattern supports the "extended" syntax as described in [boost extended format syntax](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_78_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/format/boost_format_syntax.html). [Lookahead and lookbehind](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-javascript/lookahead-and-lookbehind.html) are supported by the regular expression engine, but only for fixed length patterns. With regular expression disabled, **_n_ _, r, t_** , and placeholders are supported in both "Find" and "Replace with" patterns similarly to Notepad++'s "extended" syntax.

The G-code find/replace post-processor processes G-code in blocks, where a single G-code block is generated for each layer starting with the Z up to move to the next layer. Multiple find/replace patterns are applied one by one to one G-code block before processing the next G-code block. Matching multi-line patterns is possible, however only inside one G-code block, most likely inside a single layer. Regular expressions are powerful but tricky, thus we recommend the [regular expressions 101 online playground](https://regex101.com/) to get familiar with regular expressions and to test and fine tune the regular expressions modifying G-code before entering them into PrusaSlicer. Don't forget to switch the regex flavor to ECMAScript in the regular expressions 101 online playground.

### Example

An example of a quite powerful G-code modification by a reasonably complex regular expression: Increase the extrusion rate of top solid infill from the default 95 percent to 98 percent.
Find:


(;TYPE:Top solid infill\n)(.*?)(;TYPE:|$)(?!Top solid infill)

Replace with:


${1}M221 S98\n${2}M221 S95\n${3}

Modifiers:

_**regexp, single line**_

# [Notify me when available - How the system works](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/notify-me-when-available-how-the-system-works_302455)

Our e-shop recognizes three types of product availability:

**In stock** \- The product is in our local warehouse, and we are ready to ship it as soon as possible. Depending on the product combination in the order, it may take 1-3 working days to process the order.

**Lead time** – usually applies to most of our 3D printers. Due to the high demand, most of our 3D printers have a delivery lead time. You can see the current lead time on the product page of each printer and in all listings. The current list of all lead times is also visible in [this](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/shipping-information_2297) article.

**Out of stock** – These products are temporarily unavailable, but we are working hard to re-stock them. You can set the “Notify me when available” alert on them.

### Alert settings for registered and logged users

Click on the “Notify me when available” button on the product page.

After you hit this button, you will be immediately added to the queue for notifications, and you don’t need to do anything else. You can **manage your account and notification alerts anytime** \- just log in to our e-shop and select “In-stock Alerts” in the menu under your avatar.

### Alert settings for anonymous users

On the product detail page, click on the “Notify me when available” button.

You can enter the e-mail address into the **pop-up window** to receive the notification. If you have the Prusa Account registered with your e-mail address, you need to log in.

### Processing the queue of e-mail alerts

We are processing the queue of alerts according to the date and time when the e-mail was added.

However, to avoid misunderstandings and inconvenient situations, we send **alerts in batches** , based on the current stock of the product. For example, when we add 100 pieces of the product that has 100 alert requests, we will not send 100 e-mails in the first batch. Instead, we will send only **half of the notification** – in this case, 50 e-mails. After 30 minutes, the system checks the current availability again, there will be, e.g., 70 pieces on stock. So the system will send another 35 alerts. This process is repeated until the queue is empty.

# [Resin Tank Cleaning (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/resin-tank-cleaning-sl1-sl1s_302488)

Any cured bit of resin left in the tank after a print can cause failed prints (holes, missing geometry) and even damage to the print display. Firmware version 1.7.0 introduces the feature of cleaning the resin vat for cured bits or other debris left behind at the bottom of it.

How it works is that a single layer of the entire build space is cured simultaneously, capturing any solid bits that may have sunk to the bottom of the resin vat. This is then easily removed using a cleaning adaptor placed into the tank prior to running the cleaning procedure.

We recommend running the cleaning procedure before each print unless you have just changed the resin and cleaned the tank by hand.

**If there are very large pieces of debris or remnants of failed prints that have fallen off the platform**

or are stuck to the FEP film, the automatic cleaning may not work and you would have to

[clean the tank manually](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/removing-and-object-stuck-to-the-bottom-of-the-tank_1800)

.

### What you need

* **Firmware 1.7.0 installed on your printer:** Navigate the menu to System -> Firmware -> and select Check for updates. Alternatively, the firmware file can be downloaded from our Downloads page and flashed using a memory stick. Please see [Firmware updating (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-sl1-sl1s_124776) for details.
* **Cleaning adaptor:** This is part of the Example prints that can be downloaded directly to your printer from _Support - > Download example prints_ of the main menu, then printed on your SL1/SL1S. The example file is sliced for _Prusament Resin Tough Prusa Orange,_ which we ship with all Original Prusa SL1S. You can also find the adaptor for [download at Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/153276-resin-tank-cleaning-adapter) if you want to slice it yourself for another resin.



**Be aware that the Cleaning adaptor is not the same for the SL1 and the SL1S**

, due to the different platforms they use. However, the printer will always download the example file for your specific model.

### Tank cleaning procedure

The resin tank cleaning procedure is available on the screen provided once a print finishes and from the menu under _Control - > Resin Tank Cleaning_.

1. Make sure the printer is calibrated homed and the platform is clean and secured on the printer.
2. Select Resin Tank Cleaning on the screen provided once a print has finished or navigate the on-screen menu to _Control - > Resin Tank Cleaning_.
3. The tank cleaning wizard will instruct you to install the Cleaning adaptor on the tank (at the front right corner.)
4. Set the exposure time based on what is the _Initial exposure time_ (purple square) you find for the specific resin in the tank (blue arrow), in PrusaSlicer. _If there are larger pieces of debris in the tank you can try to increase the exposure time by ~5 seconds._


5. The platform will lower until the Cleaning adaptor makes contact with the FEP-film, making sure the cleaning adaptor does not move during the exposure.


6. Let the exposure process finish and wait for the tank to tilt forward and the print platform to move back up, taking the cleaning adaptor and the exposed layer of resin with it.
7. Open the lid and carefully slide the cleaning adaptor away from the platform to remove it with the cured cleaning layer still attached to the adaptor. _When removing the cleaning layer we recommend using the[protective tray](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/protective-tray/) and allowing the uncured resin to drip off before moving it out away from the tank._



_Cleaning procedure on SL1S_ _Cleaning procedure on SL1_

8. Place both the cured cleaning layer and the Cleaning Adaptor in IPA for cleaning and then dry/cure them inert.
9. The cured cleaning layer is very thin and fragile and can easily be removed from the cleaning adaptor which can be used again. Simply throw away the cured cleaning layer.



The Cleaning adaptor will have one layer added to it for each cleaning procedure but can last you a long time.

# [Cleaning adaptor missing #10125 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cleaning-adaptor-missing-10125-sl1-sl1s_302498)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message **"Cleaning adaptor was not detected, it does not seem to be correctly attached to the print platform. Attach it properly and try again."**

Error name: Cleaning adaptor missing

When running the [Resin Tank Cleaning procedure](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/resin-tank-cleaning-sl1-sl1s_302488), you must install the Cleaning adaptor. The platform will go down approx. 2/3 of the tower distance before it slows down, expecting to detect a "collision" with the adaptor within a certain range. If it does not detect the collision within this range, it gives you this error.

### How to fix it?

Please place the cleaning adaptor on the platform and start the procedure again from _Control - > Resin Tank Cleaning_, in the printer's menu.

If you do not have the cleaning adaptor, you can print it yourself - it is included as an example print in this machine's internal storage. You can also find the adaptor for [download at Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/153276-resin-tank-cleaning-adapter) if you want to slice it yourself for another resin.

# [Prusa Connect and PrusaLink explained](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusa-connect-and-prusalink-explained_302608)

Prusa Connect and PrusaLink are two remote printing solutions developed in-house by Prusa. Its origin is in the management system used in our [record-sized print farm located in Prague HQ.](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/guinness-world-records-1096-original-prusa-3d-printers-running-at-the-same-time_30677/)

* **Prusa Connect** is a cloud service for remote printing available from anywhere.
* **PrusaLink** * is the client-side running locally on your printer, accessible from local network



_*formerly known as Prusa Connect Local_

## What is Prusa Connect?

Prusa Connect ([connect.prusa3d.com](http://connect.prusa3d.com)) allows you to control your individual printers or even manage a print farm from anywhere in the world.

_Example of Prusa Connect interface (cloud service)_

It is available for free to the owners of selected Original Prusa printers (see the list below). You get a free 1 GB of cloud storage for your G-codes and telemetric data. The full list of features and pricing for end customers or businesses will be announced later on.

Furthermore, Prusa Connect is able to monitor the use of each printer individually, providing valuable statistics of your production environment.

## What is PrusaLink?

Much like [Octoprint](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/about-octoprint_1790), this remote printer-management system runs locally on your Original Prusa printer.

_Example of PrusaLink interface (local network)_

Its main goal is to provide communication between your printer and the Prusa Connect cloud. The secondary function is to provide a web interface, which can be used on your local (home) network only. Simply paste the printer's IP address into your web browser to access it. Using PrusaLink alone you can monitor your printer, upload G-codes, start or cancel a print.

## How to install and configure PrusaLink and Prusa Connect?

To use the Prusa Connect, you have to first set up the PrusaLink on your printer. The guides below will take you to step by step through the entire process.

**SLA printers** **PrusaLink** **Prusa Connect**
Original Prusa **SL1S SPEED**[built-in](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusalink-sl1-sl1s_146094)TBA (work in progress)
Original Prusa **SL1**[built-in](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusalink-sl1-sl1s_146094)TBA (work in progress)

### Next-gen Original Prusa printers

Such as the **MK4, MK3.9, MK3.5, XL, MINI/+, SL1/SL1S** as well as the other upcoming models have the PrusaLink built-in. You can connect the printer either using Wi-Fi or a wired LAN (Ethernet) network. Note that on MINI/+, you have to first [install the Wi-Fi module](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/installing-wi-fi-and-prusalink-mini-_316781) to use the wireless functionality.

### Original Prusa i3 MK3/S/+ or MK2.5/S

In this case, the PrusaLink name also refers to the required hardware solution of a Raspberry Pi (RPi). These printers don't have enough performance, therefore additional hardware is required. PrusaLink is a replacement for the discontinued [PrusaPrint solution](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusaprint-rpi-zero-and-octoprint_2180) (Octoprint and the RPi Zero W).

#### Which Raspberry Pi should I get for my i3 (MK3/S/+ or MK2.5/S)?

For your MK3/S/+, you need to get a Raspberry Pi (RPi) to make the PrusaLink and Prusa Connect work. The supported RPi boards are listed below and if you are about to purchase a new one, it is highly recommended to seek the latest generation, as the older ones might be slower.

On MK3/S/+, you can attach the RPi Zero [directly onto the printer’s mainboard](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/prusalink-and-prusa-connect-setup-mk3-s-_221744) or use the [USB connection](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/prusalink-prusa-connect-with-rpi-3-4-usb-mk2-5-s-mk3-s-_469341).
On MK2.5/S, you have to use the [USB connection](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/prusalink-prusa-connect-with-rpi-3-4-usb-mk2-5-s-mk3-s-_469341) to the RPi. Then, the PrusaLink and PrusaConnect setup is fairly similar to the MK3/S/+.

Since the RPi doesn't have internal storage, you need to get a MicroSD card. Recommended SD card: Micro SD, SDHC standard, Class 10, 8GB or more. Preferably, choose a name-brand card known to work with RPi. Do backups regularly as even a name-brand card doesn’t guarantee you won’t lose your data.

**Supported boards (GPIO connection on Einsy Rambo)**

* Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
* Raspberry Pi Zero W



**Supported boards (USB connection)**

* Raspberry Pi 4
* Raspberry Pi 3+
* Raspberry Pi 3


* Raspberry Pi Zero (without Wi-Fi) and older
* Raspberry Pi 2 and older



**What not to do while RPi Zero W/2 is connected and the printer is powered up:
**

\- Don't move any of the printer's axes by hand! Use the Move Axis menu only.

\- Don't connect or disconnect the RPi.

\- Don't insert or remove the microSD card inside the RPi.

\- Don't touch the RPi board.

\- For connecting or powering the RPi, don't use any other methods than the ones endorsed by Prusa.

\- Only follow the guidance from the official documentation issued by Prusa Research.

\- Prusa Research is not responsible for any damage done by or caused to third-party hardware.

# [How to replace a UV LED fan (SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-uv-led-fan-sl1s_304052)

For a better handling, it is recommended to

**prepare a clean workbench**

with a space of at least 1 m x 1 m (40 in x 40 in).

We're recommending a

**bright light above your workbench**

. Some parts inside the printer are dark and inadequate light could make a very difficult procedure.

**Before you start, do the following:**

- Move the cantilever with the print platform up (Menu -> Control -> Home platform). You will need more space in the following steps.

- Remove the resin tank. If you have a resin inside, pour it back into the bottle and clean the tank.

- Remove the print platform

- Turn the printer off and unplug it.

**All the removed screws will be reused. Do not throw away any screw!**

In the instructions, it is graphically showing which type of screw to prepare.

# [Fan failure #10126 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fan-failure-10126-sl1-sl1s_304352)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **Incorrect RPM reading of the fan. Please check its wiring and connection.**

This error indicates that one of the fans of the printer is not working correctly. It measured the RPM of the SL1/S fans and found one of them out of the accepted range.

Starting from firmware 1.7.0, this error replaces [Fan failure #10106 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fan-failure-10106-sl1-sl1s_168530).

### How to fix it?

**The SL1/SL1S has three fans:**

* **The LED cooling fan (indicated in the picture by a purple arrow on the left).**
* **The right blower fan (indicated in the picture by a green arrow in the middle).**
* **The filter fan (indicated in the picture by a blue arrow on the right).**



If the warning appears, please follow the maintenance steps for the fan that generated the issue: [SL1/SL1S maintenance](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/sl1-sl1s-maintenance_1951#fan-cleaning-removing-dust). When doing that, also check the cable connections of the fan to the mainboard.

If the right blower fan is the one that showed the warning, make sure that the blower gasket is still in place.

Run the Selftest once again. For SL1, navigate to _LCD menu - > Settings -> Recalibration_; for SL1S, navigate to _LCD menu - > Settings -> Calibration -> Selftest_. In case the fan also fails during the self-test, switch the connection of two of the fans, and see if the warning will be transferred to the new fan.

# [Temperature sensor failed #10210 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/temperature-sensor-failed-10210-sl1-sl1s_304370)

### What happened?

The printer displaying the message: **Reading of UV LED temperature has failed! This value is essential for the UV LED lifespan and printer safety. Please contact tech support! Current print job will be canceled.**

Error name: Temperature sensor failed

The SL1 has several sensors measuring the temperature of various parts and components of the printer. If a wire has been disconnected or damaged, or the sensor itself has been damaged it can produce this error.

Starting from firmware 1.7.0, this error replaces [Temperature sensor failed #10205 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/temperature-sensor-failed-10205-sl1-sl1s_196016).

### How to fix it?

#### Accessing the mainboard

First, make sure the plug of the sensor has not detached from the A64 mainboard. To access the mainboard:

1. Remove the 4 screws on the left and right-hand side of the printer.


2. Unplug the wire that goes to the front USB port, before sliding the front panel off.



You will now have full access to the mainboard and its connections. On the left picture, you can see the Ambient temperature sensor (thermistor) indicated by the yellow arrow, and the LED temperature sensor is connected together with its power cables, indicated by the green square.

#### Ambient temperature sensor

The sensor itself is found inside the tower, behind the back-plate. The sensor can be accessed by removing the screws on the sides

####

####

You can check the integrity of the ambient temperature sensor using a multimeter. Unplug it from the board and measure the resistance across the leads of the connector, as illustrated below. Set your meter to 200K to be within the correct range. More info in [Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117).

#### UV LED temperature sensor

This sensor is integrated into the LED PCB. If you receive the error that this has failed, check and reseat the connections of the led panel, but it may have to be replaced. It is an assembly with a heatsink and fan and can be accessed from the bottom of the printer.

The printer is displaying the message: **Reading of sensor not in range! Measured temperature: (temperature). Keep the printer out of direct sunlight at room temperature (18 - 32 °C).
**

Error name: Temperature out of range

Starting from firmware 1.7.0, this error replaces [Temperature out of range #10208 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/temperature-out-of-range-10208-sl1-sl1s_196094).

### How to fix it?

To ensure smooth operation, the printer has a set working temperature between 18 - 32 °C (64 - 89 °F). Direct sunlight or a cold garage is not ideal. Try to move the printer to a more stable indoor environment, let the temperature equalize over 30 minutes to 1 hour, and try again.

# [PrusaLink Troubleshooting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusalink-troubleshooting_304411)

This guide will help you solve the most common issues with the [PrusaLink and Prusa Connect](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusa-connect-and-prusalink-explained_302608) installed on MK4, MINI/+, XL, MK3/S/+, and MK2.5/S.

### Original Prusa MK4, MK3.9, MK3.5, XL, MINI+, MINI

#### The browser login does not work

Attempt the login using another browser, some browsers might have issues with the PrusaLink login.

#### The printer does not establish a connection (8+ minutes)

Double-check the credentials in the prusa_printer_settings.ini file, and load them again in the USB drive. On each field, ensure that there is no space before and after the = character. Having the following special characters as part of the SSID would also cause the connection to not be established, make sure they are not part of the SSID:

* \- (Dash)
* _ (Underscore)
* ' (Apostrophe)
* . (Dot)



On the MINI/+, the prusa_printer_settings.ini file might show an extra row, ensure that this is not changed (key_mgmt=WPA)

### Original Prusa i3 MK3/S/+, MK2.5/S

#### Bad X-Api-Key

If **PrusaLink** is selected in PrusaSlicer, it is necessary to enter an **API key**. For PrusaLink 0.7.0 or higher, the API key can be found in Prusa Connect, in the Settings tab, on older versions it is shown during the PrusaLink Wizard. Alternatively, select **HTTP digest** for authentication and add your PrusaLink username and password.

#### 500 internal server error

This error is caused by the printer serial number not being written properly on the printer Einsy board EEPROM. The solution is copying the serial number to the Einsy EEPROM, with the following procedure:

1. Connect a power bank, a USB charger, or another source of power (excluding a computer) to the printer USB type B port.
2. With the printer switched on, press the reset button.



#### Some options in printer detail are not available

* Make sure the printer is online and ready
* If you do not see any options at all, make sure you have the correct version 0.6.1 of the PrusaLink SD card image flashed to your RPi. In case of doubt, [download the PrusaLink SD card image again](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/prusalink-and-prusa-connect-setup-mk3-s-_221744#222170).



#### “ERR: NO IP” on LCD

#### The IP address is not shown

* Make sure the RPi port option in _LCD menu - > Settings -> RPi port_ is ON.
* Check that the green LED is on or flashing at the bottom right corner of the RPi.

If the green LED is not on or flashing, the RPi is not working. Review the soldering of the pins, and make sure the pins are long enough. You can test the Pi by connecting it to USB power, but make sure it is not connected via pins to the Einsy board in that case!

* Check that the SD card can be accessed on your computer. Try a different computer if possible, or [set up the SD card in Pi Imager again](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/prusalink-and-prusa-connect-setup-mk3-s-_221744#304787).



#### Credentials cannot be saved on RPi Imager

Ensure that the network has a password. A network without a password cannot be saved on the RPi Imager.

#### White/blank screen after finishing the Wizard

Make sure you are logged in on [connect.prusa3d.com](https://connect.prusa3d.com/).

#### Forgotten login/password to the Link’s website or printer accidentally removed from Connect

It will be necessary to go through the wizard again. Remove the prusa_printer_settings.ini file from the folder /home/pi, and [set up the SD card in Pi Imager again](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/prusalink-and-prusa-connect-setup-mk3-s-_221744#304787).

#### Flashing takes a long amount of time (20+ minutes)

* Make sure you are using a Class10 micro SD card or better. Slow microSD cards affect the speed of the flashing.
* Some computers, especially old ones, may have a slow SD card reader. Try the USB reader, if available.



#### The wizard is slow (2+ minutes to load the next page)

* PrusaLink might be still loading. Wait for a few minutes and try again.
* Make sure your computer and your printer are connected to the very same network. For example, if your computer is connected by cable and your printer is connected via WiFi, it can cause this issue.



#### The LCD shows “Starting PrusaLink” after 5+ minutes (MK3/S/+)

#### Slow uploading of the G-code to PrusaLink

The upload speed is limited while printing to prevent slowing down the print.

#### The Wizard can’t get the serial number from the printer (Err obtaining SN)

Make sure you are using the latest [firmware version](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads).

#### Error bad token

This may occur if you use PrusaLink on a different printer than the one it was set up with. In this case, make a fresh PrusaLink installation.

# [Prusa Academy](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusa-academy_326256)

The knowledgebase located here at [help.prusa3d.com](https://help.prusa3d.com/) is aimed to help user assemble the printer, service it and if needed get instructions for troubleshooting. If you want to extend your personal knowledge even further, there is a new project called [**Prusa Academy**](https://academy.prusa3d.com/en/). It is a library of online courses on 3D printing. It will cover everything from the very basics to advanced 3D topics, focused both on our products and general 3D printing related stuff.

Note that the beginners’ courses are not meant to replace our existing free sources of information, like the [Help.prusa3d.com](https://help.prusa3d.com/) or the 3D printing handbooks. It’s just that they should offer a more streamlined, beginner-friendly option, taking advantage of more interactive and visual tools.

### What courses are available already?

The main target audience of the two beginners’ courses is absolute 3D printing newbies who purchase an assembled variant of the printer. However, most of the content is equally useful for people with the kit variant, or, actually, even for owners of just about any 3D printer out there. The lessons follow a very straightforward path, getting to the first successful print as quickly as possible.

In the subsequent lessons, we focus on where to download more 3D models (introducing Printables.com), how to prepare them for 3D printing with PrusaSlicer, and ultimately, how to create your own simple designs, using Tinkercad or Fusion 360.

The Design Principles for 3D Printed Parts course was created in collaboration with Joseph Casha of the [Breaks’n’Makes](https://www.youtube.com/c/BreaksnMakes) Youtube channel. It is aimed at people who already know the basics of 3D modeling, but struggle with adapting to the specific limitations of 3D printing.

If you got one of the courses earlier for free and now you have trouble logging in, please be patient, this is just a side-effect of migrating to the new platform. Your access will be restored soon.

### How are the courses arranged?

The courses are arranged in short paragraphs, using icons and color-coding to mark extra tips, warnings, active tasks, etc. We also use tooltips to explain some technical terms without having to clutter the main text with definitions. There are also many useful links to other information sources like our blog articles or the [Help.prusa3d.com](https://help.prusa3d.com/), for inspiration and further study.

Each course contains quizzes to help you check your newly gained knowledge along the way. If you make any mistakes, you can return to the lessons, catch up, and attempt again as many times as you like. If you pass all of the quizzes successfully, you will get a nice certificate with your name on it. Keep in mind that if you don’t care about the certificate, none of the quizzes are mandatory. You don’t have to “unlock” anything, the whole content of each course is available right from the beginning. Advance at your own pace, jump back and forth, and skip whatever you want.

### How to purchase the courses?

The existing courses cost 5-10 USD in our [e-shop](https://www.prusa3d.com/). Note that you cannot mix the courses with regular products, there have to be separate orders. Right after the purchase, you will get a confirmation email with a link to the course. Then you can access it with your Prusa Account credentials (i.e. the same login as for the e-shop, Printables.com, etc.). No extra registration is needed. Also, there are no limits regarding the number of devices using the course.

The beginners' courses are **free** for customers who purchase the assembled variant of that particular printer..

# [2. MMU2S Disassembly (UPG)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-mmu2s-disassembly-upg_327801)

- Unscrew the Festo fittings QSM-M5 from both the printer and the MMU unit. If the fittings are tight, you can use the Unikey or an 8mm wrench.

- Keep the PTFE tube with the fittings aside for disassembly later.

- We will have to disconnect the buffer from the MMU unit.

- Loosen all the screws on the buffer securing the PTFE tubes connected to the MMU unit. Remove all five tubes by pulling them out.

-  **Keep the buffer** for a later disassembly in the next chapter.

- On the back of the MMU unit, slightly loosen the four screws holding the rear-PTFE holder.

- Remove all five PTFE tubes and **dispose of them immediately. These tubes will not be used again for MMU3.**

**MMU3 is designed to work with differently-sized PTFE tubes.**

Reusing MMU2S tubes during the assembly of MMU3 will result in incorrect operation.

# [Pressure equalizer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pressure-equalizer_331504)

This feature is only available in PrusaSlicer 2.5 and newer.

3D printer extruders love to extrude at a constant rate for the best extrusion consistency. However, during a print, the extrusion is typically not constant at all. Inifill is usually printed the fastest, perimeters are printed slower and the external perimeter is printed the slowest for the best surface finish and accurate dimensions. Bowden style extruders are especially sensitive to pressure fluctuations, due to the slack in bowden tube, they are not able to reproduce rapid changes in extrusion rate reliably.

The Pressure equalizer smooths sudden changes in speed between two features (e.g. between printing infill and perimeters).

You can find the Pressure equalizer settings in **Print settings - Speed**.

The acceleration limit from lower to higher speed (speed up) is called **Max volumetric slope positive**.

The acceleration limit when going from higher to lower speed (slow down) is called **Max volumetric slope negative.**

The lower the volumetric sloper value is, the smoother will the transition be. Adding these speed transition will likely increase the print time a little bit. Slowing down infill after perimeter may increase print times excessively, this can be suppressed by setting Max volumetric slope positive to zero.

We suggest using values between 2-10.

The internal perimeter is printed at a lower speed in the last segment before transitioning to the external perimeter. The infill is slowed down before transitioning to printing perimeters again. The print on the right shows bulges on external perimeters due to excess extruder pressure on a Bowden style printer, while the bulges are mitigated in the left print thanks to the pressure equalizer.

The Pressure equalizer does not need any special firmware changes and should work on essentially all FDM 3D printers.

### Linear Advance vs Pressure Equalizer

The [Linear Advance](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/linear-advance_2252) algorithm predicts the pressure build-up in the extruder when printing at higher speeds. The firmware of the printer uses that prediction to decrease the amount of filament extruded just before stopping and decelerating, which prevents blobs or artifacts at the sharp corners. In short, **it affects extrusion**.

The Pressure equalizer smooths the speed changes when transitioning from printing one feature (e.g. infill, perimeters) to another. In short, **it affects print speed**.

Both of these features can work together to achieve the same end result - smooth and accurate prints with minimal artifacts. In a way, the Pressure equalizer can make the job of Linear Advance easier, but reducing the number of sudden fast movements.

# [Drying filament](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/drying-filament_332086)

The materials used for FFF 3D printing are mostly hygroscopic. This means that they readily attract water molecules from the environment they are in. When used for printing, a material that has gathered humidity might not behave as expected.

### Prevention

Some filaments are more hygroscopic than others. When using a new material, make sure to research its properties and the best way to store it. It is best to avoid having to dry the filament if possible.

It is best to store your filaments in a closed space or box, with some desiccant material in it. If you have limited availability for this type of storage, prioritize storing filaments that are more hygroscopic. PLA, for example, doesn't change properties too much by uptaking humidity, whereas Polyamide is affected quite significantly.

To prevent any issues with the highly hygroscopic materials (polyamid, polypropylen, PVA, BVOH, ...) it is recommended to either ensure they were stored in a dry environment or dry them before every print.

You can purchase a box with the specific purpose of keeping the filament dry, or [make your own](https://blog.prusa3d.com/dryboxes-and-alternative-spool-holders-not-only-for-multimaterial-upgrade_30525/).

Another popular solution to keep your filament dry is using vacuum bags for storage. There are bags specific for filaments, but you can use any that will fit a filament inside. Keep a desiccant in the bag when storing the filament.

### How to recognize if the filament has gathered humidity

In case a material is affected by humidity, the general first signal will be a poor quality of the model surface.

Some filaments are naturally more stringy than others. Make sure to compare different results from your prints, and check our

[Stringing and oozing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/stringing-and-oozing_1805)

guide.

In some cases, the high content of water in filament can cause low layer adhesion, blobs on the prints, and bubbling and smoke during extrusion.

Polyamide, PVA, and TPU (Flex) are filaments more commonly in need of drying than more popular filaments like PLA.

### Prusament black spool

The black plastic sides of Prusament spools are firmly pressed into the cardboard cylinder. The plastic sides expand with rising temperature and cause the expansion of the cardboard center as well. When the temperature decreases plastic shrinks back to its original shape but the cardboard stays expanded which causes loosen spool. **The spools can be heated up safely up to 45 ºC without this happening.**

Alternatively, it is possible to add a screw holding the two sides of the plastic together. The screw needs to have a thread of at least 65 mm. In the pictures, we use an M4x65 screw, tightened by a 3.5mm Allen key.

After heating up the spool to above 45 ºC, the screw will need to be in the spool until the end of its use, or else the spool will fall apart.

### Prusament Grey spool

The Prusament spools with grey plastic sides are also pressed to the cardboard center, but they are also glued. **The glue added can withstand up to 90 ºC**. So there is no need to add the screw to dry this spool if this temperature is not exceeded.

The PA11CF filament uses the grey Prusament spools. It is recommended to keep this filament in a dry box between each use, even if the filament will be used soon. In case that is not possible, dry the filament before each use.

### Drying methods

#### Temperatures

Once we are sure that the spool will not fall apart, the following temperatures and times are recommended for the Prusament materials. It is important not to exceed these temperatures while drying the filament, or the filament will soften and stick together.

MaterialTemperatureTime
PLA45 ºC6 hours
PVB45 ºC8 hours
PETG55 ºC6 hours
ASA80 ºC4 hours
PC85 ºC5 hours
PCCF95 ºC4 hours
PA11CF90 ºC6 hours

#### Filament dryer

There are specialized boxes that will not only keep filaments dry but also actively remove the moisture from filaments. Usually, you are also able to keep the filament in the box while printing.

Make sure to check the specifications of the box you intend to use to make sure that it matches the drying temperature of your filament.

#### Oven

Since most people have an oven at home, this seems the easiest way to dry filament. However, some things need to be noted for filament drying in a conventional oven.

Home ovens don't have a very precise temperature measurement. The fluctuations that do not affect your food might damage your filament, especially low-temperature ones like PLA. If using an oven, make sure to have an external thermometer to correct the temperature if necessary.

Another issue is that a lot of home ovens cannot be set at a temperature low enough to dry the filaments without damaging them. Even if left for less time than recommended, high temperatures will damage the filament.

#### Food dehydrator

A different method of drying is adapting a food dehydrator to fit a filament spool inside. The adaptation is usually achieved by taking off the trays between the layers and placing the filaments inside. These dehydrators usually have only low temperatures, so check the drying temperature of your filament before purchasing one.

After drying, make sure to store the filament properly.

# [PETG sheets (Enclosure)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/petg-sheets-enclosure_332094)

###

The Original Prusa Enclosure has side panels made of PETG. See below some maintenance tips for the sheets.

### Cleaning

The PETG sheets in your enclosure can be cleaned by washing with lukewarm water containing a mild soap or a slightly acidic, neutral, or slightly alkaline detergent using a soft clean sponge. Rinse well afterward with clean water and dry with a chamois or a moist cellulose sponge. Subsequent anti-static treatment is recommended.

Fresh paint splashes, grease, smeared glazing compounds, etc. can be removed before drying by rubbing lightly with ethyl alcohol or petroleum ether on a soft cloth followed by a thorough wash and rinse as described above.

### Anti-static cleaning

Having good electrical insulating properties, the PETG sheets are subject to electric static charge and consequent dust attraction. Treatment with an anti-static agent keeps the sheet free from static charge and dust over prolonged periods.

There are some commercially available products that act at the same time as a cleaning agent and an anti-static agent.

### What not to use on the PETG sheets

Do not use abrasive or highly alkaline cleaners, acetone, benzene, leaded gasoline, or carbon tetrachloride. Never scrape with razor blades or other sharp instruments.

Remark: Cleaners and solvents generally recommended for use on PC are not necessarily compatible with the UV-protected surface of the PETG sheets.

# [Bricked printer (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/bricked-printer-sl1-sl1s_332110)

There are some fringe cases where some actions can cause the printer to stop responding to any commands. Note that these errors will not happen all the time that these actions are taken.

In this guide, we will cover the two possible scenarios, and their resolution.

### Stuck at Prusa Logo

#### Why is this happening?

This issue can happen if you have a firmware version from 1.3.0 to 1.4.2, try to update to version 1.6.0, and try to revert back to the previous version of the firmware you had installed. The screen will not change from the Prusa logo.

#### How to fix it?

1. Enter [our downloads section](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads) and download the latest firmware version.
2. Extract the **.raucb file** from the downloaded file, and save it to the USB flash drive with this name:
**sla-emergency-update.raucb**

The file name has to be exactly that. Otherwise, the procedure won't work.

3. Turn off the printer.
4. Plug in the USB drive.
5. Turn on the printer.
6. The emergency update runs in background, and is not shown on the screen.

At this stage, the boot screen still looks the same as before.

7. Once the installation is finished, the printer reboots. Wait for the touchscreen backlight to be off, and unplug the USB drive.
8. The printer should boot normally, showing the updated firmware version installed.



### Unknown printer model

This can occur on firmware version 1.6.0, or newer. This procedure should be done only if this issue was caused by multiple firmware updates.

#### Why is this happening?

Commonly, this error is shown when the exposition panel is not connected properly. This can occur when switching the boot slots twice, as an example: upgrading to 1.6.0, downgrading to 1.5.0, and re-upgrading to 1.6.0.

#### How to fix it?

As a first attempt, try reconnecting the LCD Adapter. This might help, as the printer version is recognized through this cable. If multiple attempts at this don't resolve the error, proceed with the guide below.

1. Enter [our downloads section](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads) and download the latest firmware version.
2. Extract the **.raucb file** from the downloaded file, and save it to the USB flash drive.
3. Plug in the flash drive.
4. Swipe to the right page, on the **Unknown Printer Model** page.
5. Select **Update Firmware** and install the extracted .raucb file from the USB drive.

# [9C. MK3S+ Extruder (UPG)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/9c-mk3s-extruder-upg_333386)

- Now it is time to insert the new PTFE tube. Note, that each end of the tube is different.

- One end of the tube has an **outer chamfer**. This end must be inside the hotend.

- The other side has an **inner chamfer**. This conical shape is the filament entry. This part must be outside the hotend.

- Push the PTFE tube in. Slide it all the way in and hold it!

-

Using your other hand **pull the collet out** while you keep pushing the PTFE tube in. **THIS IS CRUCIAL** for the hotend to work properly.

- After you finish inserting the new PTFE tube, check that the whole hotend is tightened up and nothing got loose during the process.

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_333999)

For a better handling, it is recommended to

**prepare a clean workbench with a space of at least 0.8 m x 0.8 m (31.5 in x 31.5 in)**

. With access from two sides or more.

We're recommending a

**bright light above your workbench**

. Some parts inside the enclosure are dark and inadequate light could make a very difficult procedure.

-  **Always read all the instructions at the current step first.** This will help you to understand, what you need to do. **Don't cut or trim unless you are told to!!!**

-  **Don't follow pictures only!** It is not enough, the written instructions are as brief as they can be. Read them.

-  **Read the comments** from the other users. They are a great source of ideas. We read them too and based on your feedback improve the manual and the entire assembly.

- Use a reasonable force. The printed parts are tough, but not unbreakable. If it doesn't fit, check your approach twice.

# [10B. MK3S+ Setup and Calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/10b-mk3s-setup-and-calibration_334155)

In the following steps, we will calibrate the IR Filament sensor iside the Chimney on the extruder. Follow the instructions carefully,

**this part is very important!**

- Using a 2.5mm Allen key, make sure the **lock screw** for the chimney is not tightened up. Don't remove it entirely. It holds the chimney together.

- Carefully tighten the **calibration screw** on the side so that the chimney moves all the way to the left.

-

When **tightening** the calibration screw, the chimney moves to the left, making it **less** sensitive to triggering.

- When **loosening** the calibration screw, the chimney moves to the right, making it **more** sensitive to triggering.

- Tighten the calibration screw until the chimney moves all the way to the left.

- Insert a 1.5mm Allen key into the extruder. Don't push it all the way in yet.

Make sure you are using the thinnest of the bundled Allen keys; 1.5mm. Do not use the 2mm one!!

# [Fire Suppression system (Enclosure)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fire-suppression-system-enclosure_335524)

The Original Prusa Enclosure can have as an add-on a Self-contained tube-style BlazeCut Fire Suppression System. The system operates automatically and independently of any power supply by reacting to high temperatures.

Our 3D printers are known to be extremely reliable and safe. We’re adding this system mainly due to the requirements of certain institutions (schools, hackerspaces, etc.) where there is a frequent requirement to have a fire suppression system.

### Operation and maintenance

The BlazeCut T Series does not require any special maintenance. It is recommended to visually inspect the system every one to three months. During the movement of the tube, bubbles of gas in the extinguishing agent will be visible. This indicates that the extinguishing agent is in the tube and the BlazeCut T Series is functional.

The fire suppression system contains gas under pressure; may explode if heated. Protect from sunlight. Store in a well-ventilated place. If medical advice is needed, have the product container or label at hand. Keep out of reach of children. Read the label before use.

It is recommended to inspect the pressure of the tube when the equipment is at operating temperature. Due to the physical and chemical properties of the agent, pressure in the tube can vary depending on the ambient temperature. The higher the ambient temperature, the higher pressure in the tube and vice versa.

### When to replace the BlazeCut System

The system will need to be replaced in the following cases:

* The system is leaking, was used, or emptied for other reasons.
* The system was exposed to direct fire.
* The tube or other parts of the system show signs of damage.



### How to proceed after system activation

The extinguishing agent does not leave a residue. Ventilate the protected enclosure properly, do not enter the area before ventilation. Remove the used system from the protected enclosure. The same procedure should be followed after the release of the extinguishing agent for other reasons (system damage etc.).

In case of fire, the system activates automatically burning the tube without previous warning. In case of fire, do not come into direct proximity to the system, there is a risk of being affected by the extinguishing agent.
In case of activation of the system do not enter the protected enclosure and do not open the covers of the protected enclosure, wait for the total release of the extinguishing agent.

### Product disposal

The discharged system consists of recyclable materials. Please dispose of this product responsibly and recycle it where possible. Dispose of the discharged system according to local waste management regulations.

For proper recycling, return charged systems to your local BlazeCut agent.

Never dispose of charged systems with the extinguishing agent to waste.

### First-aid measures

In case of direct contact with the extinguishing agent, follow the instructions below.

#### General Information

In all cases of doubt, or when symptoms persist, seek medical attention.

#### Following inhalation

Move the person to fresh air and keep them at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. If the person is not breathing or if breathing is irregular or breathing has stopped, administer artificial respiration or oxygen by trained personnel. Loosen tight clothing such as collar, tie, waistband, and belt. Do not administer adrenaline and its derivatives. Seek medical attention immediately.

#### Following skin contact

Flush/irrigate the affected area with a large amount of water. Do not use hot water. Remove contaminated clothing affected by the extinguishing agent. If you experience frostbite, seek medical attention.

#### Following eye contact

Carefully flush/irrigate with water for several minutes. If possible, remove contact lenses, if they are inserted. Continue flushing. Seek medical attention.

# [Special PA Nylon steel sheet](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/special-pa-nylon-steel-sheet_341570)

The Original Prusa magnetic heatbed is designed to hold a removable double-sided flexible spring-steel sheet, designed specifically for easy removal of printed objects from the print surface.

_Special PA Nylon steel sheet (color may differ from yours)_ _The underside of a printed object_

The special PA Nylon sheet is made for printing polyamides (Nylon) since their adhesion to standard PEI sheets is generally very poor. The sheet comes with a matt texture, similar to the [satin](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/satin-steel-sheet_196526) steel sheet with a PEI surface. The sheet is compatible with most polyamides and PETG, other materials may have insufficient adhesion and should be printed on our standard PEI sheets.

### Main attributes

* Compatible with many types of polyamide
* Made for printing without using a glue stick and other means of increasing adhesion
* Slightly textured surface
* Double-sided! Both sides can be used repeatedly
* Easy maintenance and good adhesion qualities



### Considerations

* **Never clean the special PA Nylon sheet with acetone, IPA (isopropyl alcohol), or other alcohol-based solvents (window cleaners, Windex, etc.)! This will damage the surface.**
* For easy print removal, wash the print surface with water before every printing.
* Check the proper first layer height! If the Live Z value is too low and the first layer is too squeezed, print removal may be difficult and may damage the sheet.
* PA Nylon sheet should be cleaned only with water and degreased with dish-washing soap!
* Some types of polyamide may be prone to warping and require using brim or are suitable only for printing small parts and models with sparse infill.
* Keep the sheet as clean as possible! Any grease stain will decrease adhesion.
* Live Z value needs to be readjusted if you switch sheets. See [Steel sheet profiles](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/steel-sheet-profiles_1955).
* Not scratch-resistant!!! Do not use metal spatulas with sharp edges to remove the prints. Be extremely careful when removing the print.
* Small PETG prints may require a [Brim](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/skirt-and-brim_133969#brim).



Consumable parts, such as print sheets (satin, smooth, textured, etc.) are not covered by warranty as the coatings will diminish over time. Unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship, cosmetic damage, including but not limited to scratches, dents, cracks, or other cosmetic damage is also not covered by the warranty. Only defective sheets on arrival are covered by warranty.

### Maintenance

* Wash the print surface before every print with clean water (use a wet cloth or sponge…), then dry it. Greasy stains, such as fingerprints, can be cleaned with water with dishwashing soap.
* Never use anything to clean PA Nylon steel sheet but water (with a drop of dish-washing soap)! Unlike the PEI sheets, the PA Nylon sheet must not come in contact with alcohol-based solvents (IPA, Ethyl alcohol, etc.), Acetone, window cleaners, 3DLAC, etc. Using any unrecommended solvents leads to a shorter sheet lifespan and risk of damaging the surface!
* Some types of paper towels may leave traces on the sheet (fiber pieces).



### Filaments

We have done a lot of testing and compiled our results for you to use. To easily see how to prepare your sheet for any filament type, please [see our Material table](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/materials).

### Prints don’t stick

If your print surface is perfectly clean and all grease has been removed by wiping it with a paper towel soaked in water and dish-washing soap, the first layer height is set properly and the print won’t stick, check out [First layer issues](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/first-layer-issues_1804).

Keep in mind that polyamides in general tend to warp more than other materials. Sometimes warping may be so strong that larger models (or with dense infill) detach from the surface even over the best surface adhesion. If you experience such strong warping, we recommend using another type of PA for selected print - for example, our Prusament PA11 Carbon Fiber shows almost no warping at all. You can find more in the articles about polyamide and warping.

PA Nylon print sheet has a special surface layer with smooth texture and matt looks. The surface layer is partially translucent and may show a specific “texture” of lengthwise or diagonal lines, or varying color shades. These color variations are characteristic for material under the topmost layer and don’t affect sheet performance.

_As a result of the temperatures to which the plate is exposed during printing, its surface gradually becomes glossier or may develop smaller, duller areas. This visual change does not adversely affect the printing properties and is not considered a reason for a warranty claim._

_Example of a glossier surface_ _Diagonal lines_ _Minor scratch_ _Varying color shades_ _Scratched hole_ _Horizontal lines_ _Example of a glossier surface_

# [Original Prusa Enclosure](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/original-prusa-enclosure_347479)

Enclosures help with stabilizing the inner environment and raising ambient temperatures, shields the printer from drafts and blasts of cold air, and reduces the build-up of dust on moving parts. This is vital for printing materials such as ASA, PCCF, PP, and others that have a tendency to warp.

Also, some of these materials might produce unwanted odors during printing and the enclosure helps to contain them.

The Original Prusa Enclosure is an accessory for your 3D printer that houses your Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ and provides a stable printing environment.

The frame along with the top and bottom panels are made from metal, the side panels are made from PETG plastic. The solid robust design allows several enclosures to be stacked on top of each other and secured using screws. The frame features mounting elements for the installation of various add-ons and tidy cable management.

There is enough room above the printer’s frame for the installation of the MMU2S. You can place the spool of filament inside the enclosure and lead the strand of filament to the extruder through a PTFE tube, essentially a reverse-Bowden setup, which also helps to even out the rotation of the spool, resulting in a smoother feed of filament into the extruder.

### Add-ons

Optional features can be purchased with the Enclosure or purchased later to be added.

#### Lock

Install an optional lock to prevent unauthorized access to your 3D printer - an ideal solution for schools, hackerspaces, and other public places. This lock uses a standard key.

#### Advanced filtration system

HEPA filter with 99.9% efficiency, prevents the spread of ultra-fine particles (UFPS).

The filtration system is useful when you print materials such as PC Blend Carbon Fiber and other materials that produce particles during printing. The filtration system will be also compatible with the “Smart Box” electronics, one of the future add-ons. Please note that enclosures with the Filtration System have extended lead times!

#### Fire suppression system

A self-contained tube-style fire suppression system. The system is manufactured in Europe and uses an extremely effective, clean, and safe extinguishing medium. The system operates automatically and independently of any power supply by detecting higher temperatures. Please note, that due to the shipping restrictions and costs, delivery from Prusa is available only to addresses within the EU. For US customers it's recommended to order from our partner [Printed Solid](https://www.printedsolid.com). For other countries please find your dealer [here](https://blazecut.com/contact-us/).

#### PSU cable quick release

The enclosure is designed to allow easy removal of the printer together with the PSU. However, if you plan to remove the printer more often, you can purchase this cable quick-release connector and remove only the printer.

Please note that only black PSUs from Delta are supported. If you have the silver PSU, you have to upgrade it first.

The PSU cable quick release is not compatible with the MK4 printer.

####

#### White LED strip

You can install an optional white LED strip into the enclosure to light up your 3D printer. The strip is powered by a separate PSU which will be added to your order automatically.

### Technical parameters

* **Dimensions with the LCD mounted outside:** 530 mm (w) × 545 mm (h) × 715 mm (d).
* **Dimensions with the LCD inside:** 530 mm (w) × 545 mm (h) × 640 mm (d) At least 250 mm is required in front of the enclosure for the doors to fully open.
* **Enclosure type:** Passive, heating is provided only by the 3D printer’s heatbed.
* **Weight:** 10,6 kg (23.4 lbs).
* **Basic package:** All components required to build the enclosure (frame parts, transparent side panels, top and bottom panels, mounting material, printer frame brace), temperature sensor, and documentation. Handles and optional 3D-printed accessories seen in some photos are not included in the package.

# [Arachne perimeter generator](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/arachne-perimeter-generator_352769)

The Arachne generator produces perimeter loops and gap fills with varying extrusion width. Simply put, it automatically makes perimeters wider or thinner as needed.

For years, the strategy PrusaSlicer used when generating perimeters was to offset the contour of the object with an extrusion line of constant width. This caused issues in various cases, especially when printing thin walls, text, or logos. The developers of Cura implemented a new strategy named Arachne based on the paper

. We ported the feature from Cura. We want to express our thanks to the Ultimaker Cura team led by Jaime van Kessel, for implementing this feature and for keeping Cura open-source.

The new approach produces nicer-looking prints with fewer artifacts. There is a significant reduction in gap fill, small extrusions used to fill gaps between perimeters, which also results in a reduction of print time.

One field where the Arachne perimeter generator really shows its power is when printing texts or small logos. Drawing fonts with constant line width is obviously quite difficult. The new perimeter generator doesn’t have this limitation and produces much cleaner texts even at a smaller scale. ****

_Classic perimeter generator in PrusaSlicer 2.4.2 vs Arachne in PrusaSlicer 2.5_

We have decided to set the Arachne perimeter generator as the default option. If you want to use the old perimeter generator, you can switch to it in the **Print settings - Layer and perimeters - Perimeter generator settings**.

The Detect Thin walls feature is disabled when the Arachne perimeter generator is selected as it’s not needed since Arachne always tries to adapt the extrusion width to thin lines.

You can adjust the Arachne perimeter generator settings in:
**Print settings - Advanced - Arachne perimeter generator**

### Minimum feature size

Minimum thickness of thin features, expressed in millimeters or as a percentage of the nozzle diameter.

Features thinner than this value will not be printed.

Feature thicker than the minimum will be widened to the minimum perimeter width.

### Minimum perimeter width

Width of a perimeter that will replace thin features defined by the Minimum feature size.

### Perimeter transition length

When transitioning between a different number of perimeters as the part becomes thinner, a certain amount of space is allocated to split or join the perimeter segments. This value defines the length of this transition area.

### Perimeter transitioning threshold angle

An angle at which a transition between even and odd number of perimeters should happen. A wedge shape with an angle greater than this value will not have transitions and no perimeters will be printed in the center to fill the remaining space. Lowering this value reduces the number and length of these center perimeters but may leave gaps or overextrude.

### Perimeter transition filter margin

This value is used to prevent transitioning back and forth between one extra perimeter and one fewer. It is expressed in millimeters or as a percentage of the nozzle diameter.

Increasing this margin reduces the number of transitions, which reduces the number of extrusion start/stops.

# [Logging data over serial line (MMU2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/logging-data-over-serial-line-mmu2s_355360)

Information from the data logged via serial line can be useful when doing advanced troubleshooting with your MMU2S unit or for providing it to [Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) when requested.

To obtain the log you will need to connect the printer to a Windows computer or to RPi/Linux computer.
When you connect the printer by the USB cable to a Windows computer, the printer should be showing up in the Windows Device Manager as a “COM device” under “Ports (COM & LPT). Write down or remember the number of the COM port.

The port number can be also found in the PrusaSlicer menu under _Configuration - > Flash Printer Firmware_ and then in a row labeled Serial Port. This is applicable to Linux as well.

You will also need to download the logging script. It is available for Windows and for Linux.

#### Windows

To register the Multi-material log using Windows, find the script in [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/heiswayi/10b412aa96d3f35d85f5f8c2e0075a33#file-serialportreader-ps1), and do the following:

1. Connect the printer with the USB cable to a Windows computer.
2. Paste the code from [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/heiswayi/10b412aa96d3f35d85f5f8c2e0075a33#file-serialportreader-ps1) to Notepad++.
3. Go to _File - > Save as_ and save the file as Windows PowerShell (*.ps1;*.psm1).
4. Right-click the saved script file and from the menu select “Run with PowerShell”.
5. If you get asked about “Execution Policy Change”, press “Y” [Yes].
6. When prompted for “PortName”, enter the COM port your printer uses, e.g. "COM4" and hit Enter.
7. When prompted for “BaudRate”, enter “115200” and hit Enter.
8. After that, the script will start showing the communication between the printer and the MMU2S unit. It will also start saving everything into a .log file in the same folder where the script is located. (For example “2022-08-08-MMU.log”).
9. Try to reproduce the MMU2S errors you are looking to resolve and mark down the time they occurred.
10. To stop the script from running, press Ctrl+C or close the window.



The above steps should show a log similar to the one below. This is an example of one failed attempt at the “Load to nozzle” function for filament #3 (with MMU2S firmware 1.0.6).

#### Linux

In order to run the Linux script, you will need to have installed some extra packages. You can install them using this command:


sudo apt install socat rlwrap tio moreutils


log=${1}
dev=${2:-/dev/ttyACM0}
dsc=${3}
rate=115200
prefix=${log%%_log.*}
echo $3 >${prefix}_dsc.txt
​
if [ -z "$log" ]; then
echo "Usage: $0 <log> [device] <description>"
exit 2
fi
echo "Log: $log"
echo "Port: $dev"
echo "Description: $dsc"
echo "Dsc file: ${prefix}_dsc.txt"
​
{ rlwrap -a -S '> ' tee >(sed -ue 's/^/SEND /' >&2)
| socat - "$dev,b$rate,cfmakeraw" | sed -ue 's/^/RECV /'
} 2>&1 | ts '[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%.S]' | tee "$log"



To register the Multi-material log using Linux, do the following:

1. Connect the printer with the USB cable to a Linux computer.
2. Create a .sh file using the script above (file name example: **prn-session2.sh** ).
3. You will need to know the name of the serial port the printer is connected to in your system. For example, to log to a **file test1_log.txt** , using the serial communication on **/dev/ttyACM0** and a with a description **"MMU2S logging 08-08-2022"** run the following command: **sudo ./prn-session2.sh "test1_log.txt" /dev/ttyACM0 "MMU2S logging 08-08-2022"**.
4. After that, the script will start showing the communication between the printer and the MMU2S unit. It will also start saving everything into a .log file.
5. Try to reproduce the MMU2S errors you are looking to resolve and mark down the time the error occurred.



The above steps should show a log similar to the one below. This is an example of a successful attempt at the “Load to nozzle” function for filament #1 (with MMU2S firmware 1.0.6).

# [Crash dump](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/crash-dump_364959)

The Crash dump is not used for troubleshooting normal printer errors! Please only supply the Crash dump if requested.

If there is a software crash on the printer, a Crash dump will automatically be saved in the xFlash memory. When troubleshooting the cause of the crash, our [Customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) may request this Crash dump. This feature can be used for diagnosing unusual system issues.

The Crash dump has important information about your printers, like the serial number and IP address. Sharing this data publicly is not recommended.

In Windows, it is possible to correctly recover the dump with either [PuTTY](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/crash-dump_364959#putty) or [OctoPrint](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/crash-dump_364959#octoprint).

The Crash dump to xFlash is active at any time, it is stored in xFlash and can be downloaded even after the system reboot until a D22 command (clear the current memory dump in the printer) is sent to the printer.

Using programs other than the recommended ones for the serial link might cause the dump to be unusable.

### MK2.5, MK2.5S

The MK2.5 and MK2.5S do not contain the xFlash, so the crash dump will not be saved automatically after a crash. Therefore, the crash dump can only be retrieved if the printer is already connected to a serial link at the time of the crash.

### PuTTY

Download the program [here](https://www.putty.org/). Once downloaded, start the program, then:

1. On the "Connection type" select "Serial".
2. On the field "Serial line", type the COM port that the printer is connected to (the picture is an example, check your device manager to know the COM port used in your computer).
3. Set the speed to 115200.


4. On the left side panel, go to _Category - > Terminal_.
5. Make sure that the following boxes are checked:
"Implicit CR in every LF"
"Auto warp mode initially on"
6. Under "Line discipline options", check both "Force on" options.


7. On the "Category" side panel select "Session/Logging".
8. Select "All session output".
9. Change "Log file name:" to "<your folder of choice>&Y&M&D_&T_&H_putty.log".(Example: "C:UsersPublicDownloads20220922_081522_COM13_MK3S_putty.log".)


10. Go back to "Session" add a unique name, like "MK3S_COM13" in "Saved Sessions" and click Save. The name will appear in the field below. Your Log files will be saved when the program is closed.
11. If your printer is not connected to the computer by the USB cable, connect it now. Ensure that the printer is on and **not** printing, as it will **reset** when you start the log file.
12. Select the file saved under Default Settings, and click Open. This will start the logging. **The printer will reset when connecting, make sure it is idle.**


13. You'll get a blank window where you'll see messages from the printer. Enter "D21" in Putty to get the DUMP.
14. The dump will be automatically saved in the folder you chose as a text file, or you can copy the log starting from "D21" until "ok", and paste it into a text editor like Notepad++. Compress/zip the file before sending it.
15. Note the serial number when contacting support.



### OctoPrint

In order to get the Crash dump using Octoprint, it is necessary to enable "Serial logging" in the _OctoPrint Settings - > Printer -> Serial Connection_ _- > General_ section. Scroll all the way down, check the box under "Serial logging", and click the Save button.

To get the dump, use the serial command D21 (read crash dump).

You can either download the OctoPrint serial log by going to _Settings - > Octoprint -> Logging_ and clicking on the download icon at the right of "serial.log". Or you can copy the dump from "D21" until "ok", and paste it into a text editor like Notepad++. Compress/zip the file before sending it.

If you don't use serial logging by default, disable it after the dump again.

# [How do Prusameters on Printables work?](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-do-prusameters-on-printables-work_365065)

Prusameters is our unique reward system on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/).

You can collect Prusameters for various actions and achievements. Prusameters then can be exchanged for a real spool of Prusament filament and various other physical rewards.

**The process is as follows** : Collect enough Prusameters => Choose a reward => Wait for the approval and sending of the voucher => Redeem the voucher in the e-shop

#### Prusameters and physical rewards

Every user gets an empty virtual spool of Prusament, which is displayed in the top right corner next to your avatar on Printables.com. By performing various activities, you can fill up the spool with special points called Prusameters.

When you upload a new model, the system starts tracking its performance (downloads and likes) over a 30-day period. There are up to four milestones you can hit during this period. For each consecutive milestone, you’ll get a higher amount of Prusameters. Once the 30-day period ends, the internal counters are reset but the earned Prusameters remain in your account.

There are four milestones you can hit with your models **repeatedly** every 30 days:

10 Prusameters for 30 downloads and 3 likes of your model
50 Prusameters for 100 downloads and 10 likes of your model
100 Prusameters for 200 downloads and 15 likes of your model
200 Prusameters for 400 downloads and 20 likes of your model

You can also get **non-recurring** rewards for these actions:

20 Prusameters for completed profile - avatar, bio, location, languages
10 Prusameters to publish a model. Up to 10 new models in total.
5 Prusameters to create a collection. Up to 3 non-empty collections.
From 1 to 10 Prusameters to upload a make. Up to 100 Prusameters per calendar month.

We appreciate it if you add a quality rating and upload makes regularly. A make of a model that already has many makes is rewarded with fewer Prusameters. You are not rewarded for the make of your own model, and for the second and subsequent makes of the same model.

Your virtual spool will become visually full at **350 Prusameters** , however, there’s no limit on how many Prusameters you can earn in total. The number we’ve picked is not accidental – 350 meters of filament is exactly what you can find on a real spool of Prusament. So, it only makes sense that 350 Prusameters is what you need to get a voucher for a 100% discount on a real spool of Prusament PLA, PETG, or ASA.

The vouchers are being approved manually to prevent abuse of the reward system. It can therefore take up to 2 weeks before they are approved and sent to you. Only one voucher per order can be applied.

Please note that once you exchange Prusameters for a voucher, that voucher is bound to the selected rewards and cannot be changed to a different type of reward. It also cannot be changed back to Prusameters.

You can find the current list of available rewards on the [Printables Rewards page](https://www.printables.com/prusameter/rewards). When you choose the reward you want, you’ll receive a voucher for our e-shop that will get you a 100% discount on the selected item.

#### Example of Prusameter reward calculation

Let’s say you upload a new model and it reaches 300 downloads and 30 likes during one of the 30-day periods. This grants you a total of 160 Prusameters:

10 points for the first milestone (30 downloads and 3 likes)
50 points for the second milestone (100 downloads and 10 likes)
100 points for the third milestone (200 downloads and 15 likes)

**Tips to avoid voucher request rejection:**

1) Upload only models that you designed or remixed
2) Upload quality photos of your own makes
3) The model in the make photo must match the 3D model
4) Don't upload an excessive amount of makes of miniature few-gram models
5) Do not upload the photo to multiple different models

The Prusameters reward system is governed by [PRINTABLES Terms and Conditions](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/terms-of-service-of-printables-com_231249/).

# [Enclosure guidepost](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/enclosure-guidepost_366332)

Original Prusa i3 Printers are open-frame printers. While some printers are already enclosed by default, having an enclosed printer can dramatically increase the price of the printer, and some enclosure types are still protected by patents.

In this guide, we will help you decide if an enclosure is needed for your Original Prusa MK3/S/+, and which one is the best fit for your use.

### When to use an enclosure

#### Warping

Plastic naturally shrinks as it cools. This will affect the parts being printed, as they are subjected to the ambient temperature and its variations. Low-temperature filaments like PLA and PETG shrink, but since it is a very small amount it is not noticeable during printing.

However, filaments that are printed at a higher temperature can cool too fast. In these cases, even if your first layer is perfect, as the higher layers shrink they will pull up the lower part of the print, causing a warping effect on the model.

So if you plan to print filaments like ASA, ABS, PC, PA (nylon), PP, or any composite filaments based on those ones (e.g. Prusament PA11 Carbon Fiber), an enclosure might be needed. If you have any doubts about which filaments need an enclosure, check our [Material Table](https://help.prusa3d.com/materials).

#### Smell

Some filaments, like ABS and to a lesser extent ASA, can emit an odor when being printed. These are usually not very strong but in case you wish to eliminate the smell you can use the enclosure. Depending on which type of enclosure you have, it is even possible to have a filter.

#### Noise

Since the Original Prusa MK3, our i3 printers are equipped with silent stepper drivers. However, the printer will still make some sounds depending on the axes' movement and vibration. Having an enclosure can help you reduce the noise so you can sit next to your printer and not hear it.

#### Practical

There are other small practical reasons to have an enclosure. Having the printer in a closed space can protect it from gathering dust. If you have pets or children, it can prevent them from touching hot parts of the printer. Depending on the enclosure, it is also possible to stack up printers or lock the printer for safety.

### What enclosure to use

After evaluating if you need an enclosure or not, it is time to decide which enclosure to use. This will depend on how often you print high-temperature filaments, the environment you have your printer in, and the amount you are willing to spend.

#### Photo studio tent

In case you only occasionally print with filaments that require an enclosure, or normally print PLA, it is possible to purchase a photo booth in any online shop and place your printer inside. We recommend an 80x80 cm booth. This will not require removing the PSU from the printer and placing it on the external part of the enclosure, as the porous material that makes the walls of the booth will not cause the internal temperature to be too high.

#### Ikea Lack DYI enclosure

We have guides for two different versions of an enclosure you can build at home with just an Ikea Lack enclosure and other materials easy to find. You can choose to make an enclosure for the [printer](https://blog.prusa3d.com/cheap-simple-3d-printer-enclosure_7785/), or the [printer + MMU](https://blog.prusa3d.com/mmu2s-printer-enclosure_30215/).

This is a great option for those that want to use the enclosure often, but are on a budget. Note that the PSU needs to be outside of the enclosure, as the Plexi walls will cause the temperature inside the enclosure to be higher than the recommended operating temperature for the PSU.

#### Original Prusa Enclosure

We also have our own Original Prusa Enclosure. This is the ultimate solution for enclosures and a vast improvement over the other options. The frame along with the top and bottom panels are made from metal. The side panels are made from PETG plastic, which is more resistant and requires less maintenance than Plexi. The solid robust design allows several enclosures to be stacked on top of each other and secured using screws. The frame features mounting elements for the installation of various add-ons and tidy cable management.

You can find more information about the Original Prusa Enclosure and its add-ons here: [Original Prusa Enclosure](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/original-prusa-enclosure_347479).

# [How to replace a heatbed set (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbed-set-mini-mini_368969)

- Before covering the electronics, make sure the square nut is correctly positioned in the printed part. The nut must not fall out! This can cause fatal damage to the electronics.

- Insert the cover back in and make sure it is properly seated in the slot. _Note: on an older design, there were holes instead of slots, the assembly procedure is the same._

-  **Place the second cover on the top and arrange the cables:**

-  **Extruder bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially in. Also, it must be tilted away from the printer.

-  **Heatbed bundle** , ensure the textile sleeve is partially inside the box.

-  **Filament sensor cable** (optional), ensure that the textile sleeve wrapped around the cables is partially inside the box.

- Now, tighten the second cover. Check that no cable is pitched.

# [Firmware in the internal flash corrupted! #12608 (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-in-the-internal-flash-corrupted-12608-mini_381775)

### What happened?

While flashing firmware to your printer an error might occur, and the screen will display the following message: "Firmware in the internal flash corrupted!". The system inside the printer consists of two subsystems. First, there is a bootloader, which then allows the firmware (operating system) to load. While flashing the firmware, something went wrong, and the bootloader is now unable to load it. **Don't worry your printer is OK! You just need to reflash the firmware.**

### How to fix it?

Each firmware is tested multiple times before being made public, so the problem is most probably in the flashing procedure.

First, place the USB flash drive back into the computer. **Delete both files and copy them again** from the computer to the USB flash drive. Don't rush and wait until the transfer is fully completed. To be 100 % sure, unmount the flash drive in your operating system before physically removing the drive from the computer. **Insert the drive back into the printer and restart it**. This should initiate the flashing procedure. If not, reboot the printer using the reset button directly next to the knob and while the printer is booting up, press once the rotating knob. This "forces" the printer to look for firmware (more about this [alternative method](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-mini-mini_124784#alternative-method-older-firmware-release)).

In case the troubleshooting in the previous paragraph didn't help. **The problem might be in the USB flash drive. Find any other USB drive** in your household, make sure it is formatted to FAT32, copy both firmware files and **repeat the previously described procedure**.

Are you still having issues? Contact our support team and let them know, that you have tried to fix the issue with these instructions. We will take it from there.

# [7. Cassette Buffer Assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/7-cassette-buffer-assembly_381796)

- Insert the first buffer plate into the marked bottom opening in the Segmenter. Push it all the way in so that the screw openings line up.

- Make sure the buffer leg and the cutout parts of the sheet are on opposite sides - as seen in the picture.

- Attach the printer holder to the marked position on the buffer sheet. For now, it should be pointed up. The sheet should attach to the bottommost opening in the printer holder.

- Orient the whole assembly so that the buffer sheet is standing up. Both the printer holder and the Leg should be on the ground.

# [Thermal model calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/thermal-model-calibration_382488)

Starting from firmware 3.12.0, the Original Prusa MK3/S/+ will have Thermal model protection. This will result in better operation when dealing with thermal errors.

### How it works

During the print, the printer is constantly comparing the temperature measured by the thermistors to a thermal model of what is expected from the printer. In case the measured temperature does not follow the model, the printer will beep and show the warning THERMAL ANOMALY, but the print will continue. If the anomaly disappears the warning goes away after 20 seconds. In case the anomaly continues, the printer will turn off the heating and activate an error. If you choose to continue the print after it stops, it is recommended to stay near the printer.

This will help in cases where the temperature issue is temporary, like when a window is opened near the printer. Also, in case the printer has a blob that wraps around the hotend, the thermal model should be able to stop the print before any damage is done to the hotend cables.

If you're interested in further details of how the thermal model works, check the [Dev diary blog](https://blog.prusa3d.com/mk3s-3-12-beta-firmware-new-thermal-model-protection-and-blob-detection_71230/).

The printer knows only that something is wrong, i.e., when the system is not performing as expected. It is up to the user to inspect the printer and check for issues.

### Calibration

When installing the new firmware, the printer will start the calibration. In case it does not go in the printer menu to _Calibration - > Thermal Model cal_. It takes around 12 minutes, after which your printer profile is automatically saved.

The Thermal model also works for third-party components. Note that if you switch components in your printer often, the Thermal Anomaly error might start to appear more often. If this happens, run the calibration again.

If you are using an enclosure, the Einsy-board needs to be

**inside**

the enclosure for the Thermal model to work, or it will cause false triggers.

### Troubleshooting

In case the Thermal anomaly message keeps showing, try first doing a [PID tuning](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pid-tuning_2265) using the temperature you normally print at, and then go _LCD Menu - > Calibration -> Thermal Model cal._, and make the Thermal calibration again

### Limitations

Since the thermal model was developed on a model of a factory-assembled extruder, it may not work correctly on some modified or after-market extruders. If you have a Revo installed on your printer, make sure you have the specific firmware found in our [GitHub page](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/releases/tag/v3.13.1).

If you experience issues during the calibration process, start the process described in [Crash dump](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/crash-dump_364959), and after the logging starts, reset the printer and enter the sequence:


M310 ;report current temp model settings
M155 S1 C3 ;enable advanced temp and fan logging
D70 I1 ;enable temp model debug logging
M310 A F1;run temp model calibration

In case you run into issues during the printing process, use the process described in [Crash dump](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/crash-dump_364959), and after the logging starts run the sequence:


M310 ;report current temp model settings
M155 S1 C3 ;enable advanced temp and fan logging
D70 I1 ;enable temp model debug logging

### Disabling the Thermal model protection

The thermal model protection can be disabled by connecting the printer to your computer (Octoprint, PuTTY...), and sending _M310 S0_. An additional _M500_ will save the setting and the Thermal model protection will remain disabled after the next restart.

# [Homing Error #12301 (MINI)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/homing-error-12301-mini_382501)

### What happened?

During calibration, mesh bed leveling, or before a print, it is crucial for the printer firmware to determine the print head and heatbed position. This is done through the **homing** process, where the print axes move to a known reference position, called **home**.

A MINI/+ printer in the home position will have the heatbed almost completely moved to the rear, and the print head completely moved right and down.

For the Z axis, two homing attempts are performed. The MINI/+ firmware uses the MINDA/SuperPINDA probe readings of their distance to the steel sheet: the homing process passes if the two readings are within +- 0.1mm. If not, the printer will show the message " **Homing Error** ".

### How to fix it?

The error might indicate an issue with the MINDA/SuperPINDA probe. Its cable can be damaged or disconnected. A mechanical issue on the Z-axis might also trigger this error.

#### Testing the MINDA/SuperPINDA probe

Follow the steps in the following article: [M.I.N.D.A./SuperPINDA sensor testing (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/m-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing-mini-mini_134021).

#### Z-axis movement

Ensure that the Z-axis can move smoothly. With the printer switched off, check the Z-axis and trapezoidal nut assembly:

* Loosen the bolts on the trapezoidal nuts, and check that both bearings are inserted correctly. The bearings must not protrude from the printed parts.
* Check both the printed parts Z-carriage and Z-carriage-back to see if one is positioned lower than the other. The two parts must be at the same height.
* Tighten the trapezoid nut evenly on both sides.
* Test the Z-axis movement by rotating with two fingers the Z-motor leadscrew. If you feel excessive resistance, slightly loosen the screws that hold the trapezoid nut.



#### MINDA/SuperPINDA probe visual inspection

Before testing the MINDA/SuperPINDA probe, you should check that the MINDA/SuperPINDA probe wires are not visibly broken. Also, make sure everything is connected to the Buddy mainboard, inside its case. Loosen the screw securing the cover (circled in the picture below), remove the top cable cover, and flip it open to reveal the board.

Check that all the connectors are secure in their sockets, according to the picture below. Focus on the MINDA/SuperPINDA (yellow arrow). Though unlikely, rough shipping or handling could have shaken the MINDA/SuperPINDA cables loose.

In case none of these tests are conclusive, do not hesitate to contact our

[Customer Support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287)

for further assistance.

### Parts replacement guide

In case you find the MINDA/SuperPINDA probe to be faulty, [please order it using our e-shop](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/superpinda/), then follow the service guide: [How to replace SuperPINDA (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-superpinda-mini-mini_179912).

# [Temp not matching heatbed #12209 (MINI/MINI+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/temp-not-matching-heatbed-12209-mini-mini_393687)

### What happened?

The printer displays the message **"Temp not matching - Measured temperature is not matching expected value. Check the thermistor is in contact with heatbed. In case of damage, replace it."** when the measured temperature is different from the temperature expected temperature for the heatbed.

This can happen if any thermistor failure on the heatbed causes the printer to read the temperature within a few degrees from the target temperature, but not the target temperature itself. The heater will keep trying to heat up while the target temperature is not reached. To prevent overheating the printer generates the error.

### How to fix it?

The error might indicate some issue with the wiring, either the heater or the thermistor cables are possibly damaged.

#### Room temperature

Check if the room where the printer is does not have a temperature below 15 ºC.

#### A visual inspection

Check the heatbed, where the thermistor and heater reside, that no wires have broken off the sensor or heater themselves. While the printer is turned off, carefully try to move the wires by hand. If any of them have come detached your search is over and the part needs to be changed. **It is not recommended to solder these wires,** moreover, for the thermistor, it will change its resistance and thus readings. Spare parts can be found in our e-shop, or you can contact [Support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) for assistance.

Try preheating the heatbed in _LCD-menu - > Settings -> Temperatures -> Heatbed_ to 90 ºC. After the temperature is reached, move the cables behind the heatbed by hand to see if the error will appear. In case the LCD main screen shows 0/0 in the heatbed temperature, check the cable connections to the Buddy board.

Loosen the one screw securing the cover (circled in the picture below), remove the top cable cover and flip it open to reveal the board.

Check that all the connectors are secure in their sockets, according to the picture below. Focus on the thermistor and heater cables (yellow arrows). Though unlikely, rough shipping or handling could have shaken the heater or thermistor cables loose.

#### Checking the resistance

The table below describes the correct resistance for each part, as well as what scale you should set your meter to. **We have another more in-depth guide on[Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117).** All thermistors are rated to be **100 kΩ at 25 °C.** To be realistic, with a varying temperature between 20 °C and 30 **°** C, **you can expect a wider range of readings (~85-125 kΩ) than with the heater.**

There can be micro-fractures in the cable, breaking the connections only at certain positions. Therefore, try to move the cable a bit while doing the measurement and see if the value changes drastically.

##### Part

##### Resistance

##### Multimeter scale

Thermistors (Bed and hotend)

**The part should be cold (room temperature) and unplugged when measuring the resistance!**

#### Where to measure

For every component, there are several options, our main focus will be on the connectors. The measurement appears on the multimeter LCD as soon as the measurement probes touch the component. To obtain the correct and relevant values, this is where you need to apply the probes:

* **Thermistors:** metal inserts in plastic connectors


* **Heater cables:** screws holding the cables in the connector



_The hot end and heat bed have the same connector. Make sure you measure the correct one._

### Parts replacement guide(s)

In case you find some parts are faulty, please order them using our e-shop, then follow the service guide(s):

# [Homing error Z #17301 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/homing-error-z-17301-xl_393700)

### What happened?

The printer displays the message " **Failed to home the Z-axis, make sure the loadcell is working** ".

Error name: Homing error Z

### How to fix it?

#### Check if the nozzle is not loose

Before proceeding further, make sure that the printer is

**FULLY COOLED DOWN AT ROOM TEMPERATURE**

, and

**OFF**

!

On single-tool XL, after **removing the x-carriage cover** , hold the heater block **(make sure that the nozzle is not heated!)** , and **use the Torx TX8 key** as shown in the picture to tighten the set screw. Do not use extra force while tightening, it may damage the hotend tube. The nozzle must be approximately at a **35°-40° angle** to avoid damaging the hotend cables.

On multi-tool XL, identify the tool that has the nozzle to be checked, and park it. Hold the heater block ( **make sure that the nozzle is not heated!** ), and use the Torx TX8 key **in the part shown in the picture** to tighten the set screw. Do not use extra force while tightening, it may damage the hotend tube. The nozzle must be approximately at a 35°-40° angle to avoid damaging the hotend cables.

#### Test the loadcell

Do not manipulate or touch the printer unless the instructions on the printer screen prompt you to do so.

A fault in the loadcell can trigger a homing error. Ensure that the printer is fully cooled down, go to _LCD Menu - Control - Calibration and test - Loadcell test_.

During the test, you will be asked to tap the nozzle at a specific time, and a progress bar on top of the screen will be filled. If the progress bar is not filled or the printer shows any errors, please contact our [customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287).

#### Reduce vibrations

Any form of vibration propagated to the surface under the printer, or a not fully stable surface under the printer might cause a false reading on the loadcell, causing the homing error to trigger.

A printer that is in operation next to your Original Prusa XL can be a possible cause of vibrations. An easy solution to dampening the noise and vibration of a printer is to add some additional padding underneath the printer.

# [Modular bed error #17501 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/modular-bed-error-17501-xl_393717)

### What happened?

In case the printer detects an unknown problem with the modular bed, the display will show the following message " **Heatbed tile no. #: Unknown error: #** ".

Error name: MB unknown error

The error message includes the number of the affected heatbed tile and a text at the end that specifies the nature of the error.

### How to fix it?

#### A visual inspection

Before accessing any of the electronic boards, ensure that the printer is

**fully cooled down**

, and

**switched off for at least 10 minutes**

.

Check that the indicated heatbed cable is correctly connected with the modular bed electronics, and with the heatbed tile, and reseat the connection.

Check the heatbed tile for physical damage, for example, a scratch on any heatbed tile surface, or a damaged cable on the bottom of a heatbed tile.

#### Swap the cables

Swap the heatbed tile connection indicated on the error with another heatbed tile connector, and check if the indicated heatbed tile number in the error changes, or remains the same after the swap.

If the error changes to another heatbed tile number after the cables swap, then the cable is causing the error.

If the error is still the same as before, with the same error code, and on the same heatbed tile number after the swap, most likely the heatbed tile is causing the error.

If your findings are different than the covered cases, or in case of any doubts, do not hesitate to contact our

# [FINDA didn't trigger #04101 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-didnt-trigger-04101-mmu_393894)

### What happened?

During Filament loading, either to the MMU unit or to the Nozzle, if the filament does not reach the SuperFINDA or is not detected, the printer will show an error.

### How to fix it?

#### FINDA

Follow this guide to make sure that your superFINDA is working and has been properly calibrated: [FINDA setup and troubleshooting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-setup-and-troubleshooting_2250).

#### Assembly

* Check if the filament has been grabbed by the idler/pulley. In case it has not, the filament is too far back.
* Make sure that the two spring screws on the sides of the MMU unit are properly tightened.
* Inspect the filament spool and the buffer for excessive friction or filament jam. Make sure the filament is able to move freely.
* Go over the assembly manual and verify if the barrel is in the correct orientation.
* Check the pulley gears for any filament remains, and make sure that the teeth are clean.
* Check that the corresponding pulley inside the MMU unit is properly aligned with the filament and is clean.



#### Selector

* Verify if the selector is in the correct position for the given filament number. After several unsuccessful retries, the selector will re-home.
* Check the selector for any filament remains and filament strings accumulated.



#### Filament

* Make sure that the PrusaSlicer settings chosen match the filament you are using.
* Check if the filament needs to be dried: [Drying filament](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/drying-filament_332086).
* The filaments must have a sharp tip in order to load properly into the printer. If the tip is deformed, bent, or larger in diameter, cut it off.
* Inspect the last 40cm (15") of each filament. Make sure there are no dents in it.
* If the filament is still not being pulled, check the [assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-setup-and-inspection_2233#assembly-inspection).

# [FINDA: Filament Stuck #04102 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-filament-stuck-04102-mmu_394505)

### What happened?

While the MMU unit was unloading a filament, the SuperFINDA sensor inside the selector stayed triggered/detecting a filament, while it shouldn’t.

The superFINDA might be referred to as FINDA on the printer.

### How to fix it?

Check if the filament has been unloaded or not.

If the filament has been unloaded, but the superFINDA is still triggered, open the Festo fitting connected to the selector, and check if there is anything stuck in the selector (e.g. broken filament, string).

Also, make sure that the superFINDA is working: [FINDA setup and troubleshooting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-setup-and-troubleshooting_2250).

In case the filament is stuck between the MMU unit and the extruder, remove the PTFE tube from the FESTO fitting. Remove any debris that might be stuck in the PTFE tube. pull out approx. 40cm of filament and inspect it for indents. If there are any, cut off the damaged part of the filament, re-install the PTFE tube, and hit Retry.

Make sure that the tip of the filament is sharp, and not stringy or expanded so that the issue does not happen again.

If there is any debris or broken pieces of filament inside the selector, it can be cleared up using the 1.5mm Allen key, if you remove the FESTO fitting and move the selector all the way to the right. If the SuperFINDA sensor was triggered due to debris / broken filament, the actual filament might be far behind the pulley wheel and might need pushing into the MMU from the back, while retrying the loading operation.

Multi-material operation is sensitive to proper temperature settings. Check that you are using the correct settings for the given material in Slicer. Incorrect nozzle temperatures will cause issues with filament load/unload. Note that with MMU, some 3rd party filaments might behave differently than during the single-material operation even with the same settings.

Some filaments sensitive to moisture might need to be dried out before use. Moist filaments are usually more stringy and this might cause the filaments to jam. You can read more about how to lower the stringing in our [Stringing and oozing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/stringing-and-oozing_1805) article.

It is recommended to use only high-quality filaments. Certain poor-quality filaments or very specific filament types won’t work correctly with the MMU. In this case, change the slicer settings according to the manufacturer's instructions.

# [Filament sensor didn't trigger #04103 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-sensor-didnt-trigger-04103-mmu_394514)

### What happened?

If during the filament load to nozzle process, the filament sensor in the extruder is not triggered, the printer will show the error.

### How to fix it?

#### Assembly

#### Filament

* The filaments must have a sharp tip in order to load properly into the printer. If the tip is deformed, bent, or larger in diameter, cut it off.
* Inspect the last 40cm (15") of each filament. Make sure there are no dents in it.
* If the filament is still not being pulled, check the [assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-setup-and-inspection_2233#assembly-inspection).

---

# [Filament sensor: Fil. stuck #04104 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-sensor-fil-stuck-04104-mmu_394535)

### What happened?

When the MMU unit unloads a filament from the extruder, the filament sensor inside the extruder should stop detecting the filament. In case it does not, this error appears.

If there is an issue with unloading, the MMU gears might grind the filament. In case this happens, cut off about 40 cm at the of the filament, otherwise, errors might happen later.

### How to fix it?

Check the PTFE tube that leads from the MMU unit to the extruder, and see if the filament has been unloaded or not.

In case the filament has been unloaded, but the printer shows this error, remake the [filament sensor calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-calibration-mmu2s_2245).

#### Extruder

In case the filament has not been unloaded, make sure that the nozzle is heated for the filament you are using. Then open the Extruder idler screw and the Festo fitting on the top of the extruder, and manually pull the filament. Note that some force might be necessary.

On the MK3S, check the [alignment of the idler door and the Bondtech gears](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/checking-re-aligning-the-bondtech-gear-mk3s-mk2-5s_133176). On the idler door, check if the gear is moving freely and that the shaft is connected to both sides of the plastic part.

Make sure that there is no debris or pieces of filament in the idler door or extruder gears causing the filament sensor to falsely trigger.

MK3S/+MK4

#### Filament

Check that you are using the correct settings for your filament with the manufacturer. Filaments that have a lot of stringing might cause the filament to jam.

Before starting the printer operation again, make sure that the filament is straight and cut into a sharp tip, and that there is no damage on the first 40 cm of the filament.

In case the issue continues to happen over multiple unloads, check the [extruder for clogging](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3-5-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008).

In case the issue persists due to deformed filament tips, try [changing the PTFE tube](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-hotend-ptfe-tube-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_21664).

# [Pulley cannot move #04105 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/pulley-cannot-move-04105-mmu_394613)

### What happened?

The printer is showing the message **"Pulley motor stalled. Ensure the pulley can move and check the wiring."**.

Error name: Pulley cannot move

The Pulley motor is the one that moves the 5 pulleys in the MMU unit.

### How to fix it?

Open the two spring screws on the MMU unit, and make sure that nothing is preventing the motor from moving.

In case there is nothing, check the motor connection to the MMU board.

# [How to use Prusament refill](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-use-prusament-refill_394630)

Prusament Refill is designed to fill up empty filament spools. Once you run out of filament, detach the black plastic sides of the spool and attach them to the Prusament Refill. Read more about the refill procedure below.

### Basic information

The Prusament spool consists of black plastic sides and a cardboard centerpiece. The sides are pushed on the centerpiece and can be removed, either to be reused or recycled.

_Please note there are also gray Prusament spools that are used for advanced materials. The sides are glued to the cardboard centerpiece as some filaments require drying up in high temperatures._

### Assembling the refill spool

1) Take an empty Prusament spool. It is necessary to separate the sides of the spool from the cardboard centerpiece. Pull the ends of the spool apart using a reasonable amount of force and gradually rotate the spool bit by bit. Thanks to this movement, it will be easier to separate the sides from the center of the spool.

_Tip: If you don't have enough force to separate the parts, try soaking the spool. The cardboard center will then loosen immediately._

2) Once you remove one side, do the same with the other side of the spool. The cardboard centerpiece is then no longer needed.

3) Prepare a new Prusament Refill. Do not remove the orange tape! Attach the Refill bundle to the center of one side. We recommend placing the side with Refill on a flat surface. Lean into the center of the Refill to push down. It helps if you rotate the side and gradually push the Refill in multiple places. Continue until the center of the Refill is fully pushed in and firmly attached

4) Use the same process to attach the other spool side.

5) When the spool is firmly assembled, only then cut off the orange strips. We recommend scissors, as you could accidentally cut the filament with a knife or injure yourself.

6) The spool is ready to print!

_Tip: All Prusament Refill spools have a wide secure strip on which is stuck a small paper label with information about the material. This label can be taped on the plastic sides of your old spool to let you know what material it is.
_

### What to do with the old cardboard centerpiece?

Recycle it according to your local regulations or reuse it. Here are some [interesting reuse ideas](https://blog.prusa3d.com/prusament-spools-reuse-ideas_8875/).

### Where to get Prusament Refill?

Prusament Refill is available at our [e-shop](https://www.prusa3d.com/search/?q=refill).

# [Nozzle Cleaning Failed (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/nozzle-cleaning-failed-xl_395809)

To achieve good quality prints, it is fundamental that the nozzle can make the right amount of contact with the print surface. In case this is not achieved, the printer will show the message " **nozzle cleaning failed** ".

### How to fix it

#### Nozzle cleaning

**CAUTION**

: Heated parts can cause severe burns!

Check if the nozzle has residue. Debris on the nozzle or heater block can affect its thermal properties. To clean it, heat the nozzle for three to five minutes at 250 °C, as the remains of the filament must be warmed up slightly so that they can be removed more easily.

Use a small brass brush to clear away any old plastic stuck on the nozzle and heaterblock.

Avoid contact of the brush with the hotend cables, as this could cause a short circuit.

**Caution: the printer is still at a hot temperature! Wait until the hot parts are cooled down to ambient temperature. It takes approximately 10 minutes.**

#### Steel sheet cleaning

Make sure that the steel sheet is clean of any residue. For the smooth, textured, or satin sheet, clean with 90% or higher percentage isopropyl alcohol (IPA).

#### Check if the nozzle is not loose

Before proceeding further, make sure that the printer is

**FULLY COOLED DOWN AT ROOM TEMPERATURE**

, and

**OFF**

!

On single-tool XL, after **removing the x-carriage cover** , hold the heater block **(make sure that the nozzle is not heated!)** , and **use the Torx TX8 key** as shown in the picture to tighten the set screw. Do not use extra force while tightening, it may damage the hotend tube. The nozzle must be approximately at a **35°-40° angle** to avoid damaging the hotend cables.

On multi-tool XL, identify the tool that has the nozzle to be checked, and park it. Hold the heater block ( **make sure that the nozzle is not heated!** ), and use the Torx TX8 key **in the part shown in the picture** to tighten the set screw. Do not use extra force while tightening, it may damage the hotend tube. The nozzle must be approximately at a 35°-40° angle to avoid damaging the hotend cables.

#### Check the Z-axis bearing housing

The Z-axis bearing housings are the end-stop for the Z-axis. It is important to have a tiny clearance between the **Z-axis bearing housings** and the **heatbed frame** when the printer is at the top position.

This way, during the mesh bed leveling and the autohome procedures, there can be an ideal amount of tiny contact between the nozzle and the print surface.

Too small of a clearance can cause the **Nozzle Cleaning Failed** warning message to appear. In this case, in order to achieve the ideal clearance, **slightly loosen the bolts** holding the **bearing housings** in place.

If the warning message still appears, sightly loosen the mentioned bolts once again, keeping in mind to **still have the Z-axis bearing housings** **reasonably tight and held in place**.

Once you find an ideal tightness for the bolts that works and holds the Z-axis bearing housings in place, keep the change permanently.

**Do not remove the bearing housings from their place! This will cause damage to the printer.**

# [Extruder preheat error #17202 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extruder-preheat-error-17202-xl_395825)

### What happened?

The message **"Extruder preheat error: Check the heater and thermistor wiring for potential damage"** is shown when the printer is unable to heat up the nozzle more than 2 ºC for 20 seconds. The printer starts a safety feature, which instantly kills the heating process and displays the message on the screen. The printer then waits for the user to inspect all parts and if needed fix the issue.

Error name: Hotend preheat error

### How to fix it?

Most often, this error happens due to wiring damage or connection issue on the hotend heater cable. Less often, it might be caused by the hotend thermistor wiring and connection.

#### A visual inspection

Before breaking out the multimeter you should check the Dwarf board, where the thermistor and heater reside, to ensure that no wires have broken off, or are disconnected.

Before you start, make sure:

* the filament is unloaded from the extruder
* the printer is turned OFF and unplugged from electricity
* the hotend and the heatbed are cooled down to ambient temperature



Because we will handle tools and work with the extruder high above the heatbed, it is necessary to protect it.

Place an empty Prusament cardboard box approximately to the front center part of the heated. Move the X-axis all the way to the front side of the printer, and move the extruder approximately to the center of the X-axis.

Open the dwarf-cover-door to access the Dwarf board.

Check that all the connectors are secure in their sockets, according to the picture below. Focus on the thermistor and heater cables. Though unlikely, rough shipping or handling could have shaken the heater or thermistor cables loose.

#### Checking the resistance

The table below describes the correct resistance for each part, as well as what scale you should set your meter to. The hotend thermistor is rated to be **100 kΩ at 25 °C.** To be realistic, with a varying temperature between 20 °C and 30 **°** C, **you can expect a wider range of readings (~80-125 kΩ).**

There can be micro-fractures in the cable, breaking the connections only at certain positions. Therefore, try to move the cable a bit while doing the measurement and see if the value changes drastically.

# [Extruder thermal runaway #17204 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extruder-thermal-runaway-17204-xl_395841)

### What happened?

The printer will display **"Extruder thermal runaway: Check the thermistor wiring for potential damage"** if the temperature on the nozzle drops by 6 ºC for an extended period of time. This temperature drop would usually not be an issue, but if the heat is not recovered after 20 seconds the error will happen. In this case, the printer will stop the heating and display the message on the screen. The printer then waits for the user to inspect all parts and if needed fix the issue.

Error name: Hotend thermal runaway

### How to fix it?

The error might indicate some issue with the wiring, either the heater or the thermistor cables are possibly damaged.

# [Idler cannot home #04125 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/idler-cannot-home-04125-mmu_395865)

### What happened?

Before it can align with any of the filament positions, the Idler inside the MMU unit needs to be “homed” to determine its position. First, the Idler moves to one end of the travel (endstop). Then, it moves to the other endstop, while measuring the angle between the end stops. The idler homes after the unit starts up has been reset or after another error occurred.

In case it can’t find the first homing endstop or the distance between the two endstops differs from the expected value, the printer will show an error.

Distance between the Idler endstops: 225 degrees
Allowed deviation: 10 degrees

Endstops are detected using the StallGuard function. Note that the Stallguard readings are ignored while the Idler moves over the filaments to mitigate false readings.

### How to fix it?

The issue is usually mechanical. If you get this error, check the following items:

* Verify there is no debris around the Idler and that it can move freely.
* Release the idler tension screws slightly. If it is too tight, it will disable the Idler from moving freely.


*   * Verify is the **Idler Coupler** is attached properly. Check both **grub screws on the Idler Coupler** are tightened and that one of the screws is facing the flat part of the motor shaft. Make sure the Idler doesn’t push against the Idler body so that it can rotate freely.


* Especially the first time you are running the MMU, check that the motors are connected in the correct order.
* Verify all the bearings can move freely and that the center shaft at the end is inserted into the Idler properly.
* In some very specific cases or on modified units or in other unsupported setups; changing the stall guard thresholds might help.
* In case you are using the older MMU2S unit, check the [MMU idler unable to move freely article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu2s-idler-unable-to-move-freely_1996).

# [Selector cannot home #04115 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selector-cannot-home-04115-mmu_396152)

### What happened?

Before it can align with any of the filament positions, the selector on the MMU unit needs to be “homed” to determine its position. For that, the selector moves from one end stop to the other while measuring the distance between them. The selector will home after the unit starts up, has been reset, or after another error occurred.

In case the Selector can't find the first homing endstop, or the distance between the endstops differs from the expected value, the printer will show this error.

Distance between the Selector endstops: 75mm
Allowed deviation: 3mm

### How to fix it?

The selector might not move due to obstacles, debris, or remaining filament in its way. Before proceeding, make sure that the path of the selector is clean, and that any filament that has been cut by the selector blade is removed.

Clean also any filament that might be under the selector in the pulley body.

#### Clearing the Selector

Open the front Festo fitting to check the Selector.

If there is filament sticking out from the front PTFE tube, or sticking out from the MMU unit into the selector, take an Allen key to push the filament back.

If the selector has tried to move with the filament still inside it, turn the printer off, and manually turn the motor threaded rod until it aligns with the pulley body and you can pull the filament from the back of the MMU unit or push from the front of the selector with an Allen key. After that, [adjust the FINDA height](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-setup-and-troubleshooting_2250).

#### Assembly

In case the Selector is clean from filaments, check the following items in the **MMU unit assembly**.

* Verify if the [**SuperFINDA**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-setup-and-troubleshooting_2250) sensor reads correctly.
* The **trapezoid nut** on the selector motor might be loose or offset to one side. Remake the [Selector motor installation](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-pulley-body-assembly_328918#331552).
* The **bushing tubes** should be flush with the body of the Selector.



Both bushing tubes and the trapezoid nut are self-lubricating. Do not apply any lubricant to the trapezoid nut.

* The selector motor **** must not be loose on the MMU unit body. The top corner screw should be tightened slightly looser compared to the other two. The two screws should be tightened evenly. Remake the [Selector motor installation](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-pulley-body-assembly_328918#331552).
* In case you have printed the parts yourself, check if the **printed parts** do not have any surfaces that are lifted.
* Especially the **first time** you are using the MMU unit, verify that the motors are connected in the correct order.

# [Tilt moving failed #10104 (SL1/SL1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tilt-moving-failed-10104-sl1-sl1s_398887)

### What happened?

The printer is displaying the message: **Moving the tilt failed. Make sure there is no obstacle in its path and repeat the action**.

Error name: Tilt moving failed

Issued when the printer has a mechanical failure when trying to move the tilt mechanism.

### How to fix it?

The inability to move the tilt might indicate that there is a physical block of the tilt mechanism or an assembly error in the motor and the connecting rod. Please follow these steps to check the tilt assembly.

1. Open the eight M3x5b screws securing the cover. **Be careful to unplug the USB & Power-cable before removing the cover completely.**


2. Remove the M4x10 screw holding the right side of the touch screen. It is not necessary to remove the left screw. Just loosen it about a half-turn and you can slide the screen out, like a door. This will give you access to the motor and connecting rod.



Be very careful with the touch screen flat cable. It is fragile and can be easily damaged or cut.

3. Move the connecting rod with your hands and see if it has a full range of motion and if the blade sensor-trigger is between the two sides of the sensor. If so, jump to step 12. If any resistance is found, continue with the next step.


4. Remove the M3nN-nut from the screw that connects the tilt-mechanism and the connecting rod. You can do that by using a spanner or pliers to hold the nut and an Allen key to unscrew from the other side.


5. Remove the two M4x8 screws securing the tilt-motor holder to the bottom plate.


6. Remove the motor-holder and the connecting-rod from the tilt mechanism.
7. Go to [Step 18](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544#9384) of [2\. Base & Tower](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-tower_8544) of the assembly guide, and remake the connection of the connecting rod and the motor shaft.



Pay extra attention to this step, as not aligning the connecting rod with the protrusion on the holder as instructed will cause the issue again.

8. Reassemble first the tilt to the connecting rod, make sure that after tightening the nut the two parts are in contact.



Do not over-tighten the nut!

9. Connect the motor holder to the bottom plate using the M4x8 screws.


10. Make sure that the optical sensor cable has its correct end connected to the sensor. The middle wire should be blue. In case the middle wire on the sensor connector is black, the connection will need to be swapped.
11. Move the connecting-rod manually and see if it moves smoothly until the blade sensor-trigger is between the two sides of the sensor.



Make sure the sensor is secured!

12. Slide the LCD back to its place, and tighten both M4x10 screws holding it.


13. Connect the USB and Power cable and close the eight M3x5b screws that hold the cover. Tighten them diagonally at first, and add all the screws before tightening them. Pay attention to the cables from the electronics so that they are not pinched.


14. Run the wizard again.

# [Measurement tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/measurement-tool_399451)

The measurement tool is a feature long demanded by our community. It's available starting with PrusaSlicer 2.6 alpha.

The measurement tool utilizes a geometry detection algorithm that recognizes points (vertices), edges, circles, and planes. Users can check model dimensions and angles directly in PrusaSlicer.

You'll find the tool in the left toolbar.

The Measurement tool allows you to uniformly scale the object to the required length by clicking on the measured distance in the scene.

It is possible to measure distances and angles between parts of a single object to better align them, but not between separate objects.

One of the current limitations of this tool is its behavior on objects with overlapping parts. In such cases, the parts are considered individually, meaning that edges created by the intersections are not detected, and planes hidden inside other parts are. The tool also does not work well with negative volumes, which are considered parts.

---

# [Text tool](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/text-tool_399460)

The Text tool lets you easily add labels, notes, signs, serial or version numbers to your models directly in PrusaSlicer. You can add text to any type of surface, not just planar faces, but even to curved surfaces. The text entities are fully editable even after re-opening a saved project file.

### Adding text to existing models

Select the target model and press the T key. Alternatively, you can right-click on the model and select _Add part - Text_ , from the context menu.

### Creating standalone text objects

Right-click the platter and select _Add shape - Text_. This will create a standalone object not connected to other objects in the project.

### Text manipulation

You can manipulate the text by dragging it around the object and placing it in the desired position. When you're dragging the text object on the model, a white marker will appear, highlighting the position at which the surface normal is calculated.

You also have the option to rotate the text along the Z-axis (Z-rot) and elevate it along the Z-axis (Z-move).

### Fonts

The text tool automatically import's the font library on your device. Any TrueType Font (TTF) should work correctly. If you install a new font on your device, you don't have to restart PrusaSlicer to be able to use it, simply close and open the text tool again and PrusaSlicer will load the newly added fonts.

### Text presets

You can save and load text presets. These include all the text settings, such as the selected font, the text height, and depth, but also all of the advanced settings. Text presets are especially useful if you want to maintain a consistent text style when creating version numbers and similar labels.

### Embossing, debossing and modifiers

In the Text tool context menu, you can select whether the text is to object:

* Added - this creates a new part and embosses the text

# [IPA pigment filter (CW1/CW1S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ipa-pigment-filter-cw1-cw1s_399494)

The [Original Prusa Curing and Washing Machine (CW1/S)](https://cdn.prusa3d.com/downloads/manual/prusa3d_manual_cw1s_en_1_02.pdf) uses isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to wash the uncured resin around the print model before curing it. The resin usually leaves pigment in the IPA, especially on the first wash. This can stain other models when you reuse the same IPA. To solve this issue, we have developed a cellulose filter that fits into the [CW1/S](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cw1-s-basic-use-and-lcd-menu_112305).

### The filter

The IPA pigment filter consists of a special folded cellulose filter with 12 double-sided cutout ribs. It is meant to remove the color pigment from the IPA that is used in the [CW1/S](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cw1-s-basic-use-and-lcd-menu_112305). The filter also removes the filler, which can leave a white powder on the model after washing, from the IPA.

Note that IPA will not have an extended lifespan in terms of the effectiveness of removing the resin from the model, it just cleans the pigment so that the next prints are not stained.

### Where to find it

The filter can be found in [the eshop](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/ipa-pigment-filter/) _._ The purchased part is the filter and the holder must be printed (available at [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/462448-ipa-pigment-filter-holder)). You can find how to assemble the parts here: [IPA pigment filter](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/ipa-pigment-filter_397213).

The holder can also be printed by an FFF printer with PETG filament. Note that in this case, the holder's lifespan will be shorter than if printed with resin.

### How to use it

#### Firmware 3.3.0 and newer (recommended method)

Starting from firmware 3.3.0, the CW1/S has the IPA filtering option in the menu. This mode will spin in one direction for 40 minutes to filter the IPA.

Also starting in this firmware, the washing mode will spin in both directions. This direction change is not good for filtering, so do not use the washing mode to filter the IPA.

#### Firmware 3.1.0 and older

Firmware 3.1.0 and previous releases are not supported, therefore it is recommended to use release 3.3.0. In case you are unable to update, there is a unofficial and not recommended solution.

_After inserting the filter assembly on the[CW1/S tank lid](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/ipa-pigment-filter_397213#399002), you can place the tank on the machine. In the CW1/S menu, go to Run-time -> Washing run-time, and set it to 10 minutes. Use this mode four times to filter the IPA (40 minutes in total)._

### Disposal

The filter is rated for up to 10 uses. Before discarding the filter, cure it in your CW1/S for at least 20 minutes.

# [Extruder temp not matching #17210 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/extruder-temp-not-matching-17210-xl_399953)

### What happened?

The Original Prusa XL continuously monitors the temperature of the tool head in use and its variation with respect to an expected reference. In case the printer recognizes a variation out of the acceptable range, it will display the following message: " **Measured temperature is not matching expected value. Check if the thermistor is in contact with the heaterblock. In case of damage, replace it** ".

Error name: Hotend temp not matching

In this case, the printer will stop the heating and display the message on the screen. The printer then waits for the user to inspect all parts and if needed fix the issue.

### How to fix it?

The error might indicate an issue with the wiring, either the heater or the thermistor cables are possibly damaged.

#### A visual inspection

Before breaking out the multimeter you should check the Dwarf board, where the thermistor and heater reside, to ensure that no wires have broken off, or are disconnected.

Before you start, make sure:

* the filament is unloaded from the extruder
* the printer is turned OFF and unplugged from electricity
* the hotend and the heatbed are cooled down to ambient temperature



Because we will handle tools and work with the extruder high above the heatbed, it is necessary to protect it.

Place an empty Prusament cardboard box approximately to the front center part of the heated. Move the X-axis all the way to the front side of the printer, and move the extruder approximately to the center of the X-axis.

Open the dwarf-cover-door to access the Dwarf board.

Check that all the connectors are secure in their sockets, according to the picture below. Focus on the thermistor and heater cables. Though unlikely, rough shipping or handling could have shaken the heater or thermistor cables loose.

#### Checking the resistance

The table below describes the correct resistance for each part, as well as what scale you should set your meter to. The hotend thermistor is rated to be **100 kΩ at 25 °C.** To be realistic, with a varying temperature between 20 °C and 30 **°** C, **you can expect a wider range of readings (~80-125 kΩ).**

There can be micro-fractures in the cable, breaking the connections only at certain positions. Therefore, try to move the cable a bit while doing the measurement and see if the value changes drastically.

##### Part

##### Resistance

##### Multimeter scale

**The part should be cold (room temperature) and unplugged when measuring the resistance!**

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_400300)

- If you prefer to print the plastic parts yourself, use the pre-sliced G-codes and print all the required parts before proceeding with the assembly.

The printed parts **must be printed perfectly** in order for the MMU3 to work correctly: no warping or lifted corners, stringing or other irregularities.

If you can’t guarantee the parts being flawless, get the MMU3 kit with the factory-printed plastic parts instead of printing it yourself.

- In case some parts get broken during the assembly, you can reprint them. Please check all plastic parts before starting your build to make sure there are no issues.

The recommended material is PETG.

If you opt to slice the parts yourself, use PrusaSlicer with 0.2 mm layer height, GRID infill at 20%. No supports are required.

# [Filament sensor too early #04106 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-sensor-too-early-04106-mmu_400835)

### What happened?

Implausible reading by the Filament sensor inside the extruder, while loading a filament. The filament shouldn't be in the extruder yet but is detected there anyway.

### How to fix it?

Remake the [IR filament sensor calibration (MMU2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-calibration-mmu2s_2245).

Open the extruder idler and make sure that there is no leftover filament in the extruder causing the sensor to trigger too early.

# [Inspect FINDA #04107 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/inspect-finda-04107-mmu_400896)

The selector on the MMU unit needs to move or re-home but a filament inside it is detected unexpectedly by SuperFINDA sensor. The selector can’t proceed because there might be filament in it.

### How to fix it?

It is possible to check the FINDA status either by checking the light on top of it or on the LCD.

If there is no filament under the SuperFINDA sensor but its status is still 1, check the Selector for any leftover filament or debris.

If necessary, recalibrate the [superFINDA](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-setup-and-troubleshooting_2250) by following the [assembly guide chapter to re-calibrate the SuperFINDA sensor.](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/10b-mk3s-setup-and-calibration_334155)

Clear the selector from any filament or debris causing the SuperFINDA sensor to remain triggered.

Error name: Bed thermal runaway

Error code: #13203 (MK4) #21203 (MK3.9) #23203 (MK3.5)

**Thermal Runaway** is a safety feature designed to cut power to the heaters in case of a cable malfunction. If your printer's thermistor somehow dislodges itself, electronic parts can get a lower (incorrect) temperature reading. In an attempt to compensate for the lower temperature, the heater could reach dangerously high temperatures.

If the **heatbed** temperature drops by more than **2 ºC** for over **60 seconds** , the printer will shut down the print and show the Thermal Runaway error.

### How to fix it?

Make sure that the ambient temperature is above **10 ºC** , and that there are **no sources of cooling** near the printer, like air conditioning or windows.

Check if the thermistor is well secured under the **golden Kapton tape**.

If you are printing small objects with high-temperature filaments, try to print multiple at once and/or place them away from the center of the heatbed.

Open the **xBuddyBox-cover** and the **el-box-cover** by opening the screws indicated below to access the heatbed cables. Make sure that the heatbed power cable did not slip from the screw, and that the heatbed thermistor cable is well connected.

If you have a multimeter, you can check the resistance of the cables using this guide: [Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117).

# [Regular printer maintenance (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/regular-printer-maintenance-xl_401237)

It is recommended to regularly take some time to maintain your Original Prusa XL. This should be done even if the printer is working perfectly. **The inspection and maintenance of its various components should be done every ~200-300 hours of print time**.

Besides the usual tools, such as Allen keys, needle-nose pliers, and IPA (IsoPropyl Alcohol) + paper towels, you might need:

* **Compressed air** : also known as canned air. Be sure to not hold it upside down while spraying - otherwise, you could damage any electronic components while trying to clean them.
* **Brush** : a small brass brush is a useful tool for cleaning the heaterblock. If you don't have a brass brush any brush with hard bristles will do the job.
* **Prusa Lubricant** : a tube of Prusa Lubricant is included with the Original Prusa XL. It is used in the Z-axis leadscrew paragraph.



**DO NOT use Prusa Lubricant on the linear rails!**

### Axes check

Ensure that there is no debris or dust on the **linear rails**. If there is, clean them using a clean paper tissue or a clean cloth **with NO de-greaser** and **with no chemicals** , as these might damage the rubber in the carriage. The factory lubrication for linear rails is effective for at least 2 years.

### Z-axis leadscrew

After ~500 hours of print time, lubricate the Z-axis leadscrews: apply **a tiny bit of Prusa Lubricant** on the Z-axis leadscrews. After this, move the Z-axis all the way down, and then all the way up.

### Belt

Attach the belt tensioner on the top belt on the X-axis. The belt tensioner has a pointer, check if it is in the optimal range. The ideal position of the pointer is in the center area, closer to the max mark.

### Flexible steel sheet

All flexible steel sheets should be cleaned regularly to ensure adhesion, but the exact methods and washing solutions can differ depending on your type of sheet.

You can find more information on how to take care of your flexible steel sheet [in this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flexible-steel-sheets-guidepost_2195).

Acetone should be used sparingly for cleaning, and only be used on the Smooth steel sheet!

**Never use acetone on the Textured or Satin steel sheet**

as the surface will be permanently damaged.

### Fans

The Original Prusa XL is equipped with a hotend fan, and with a print fan. The printer can detect if any of its fans stop spinning. However, that does not mean you should not check them during maintenance. Dust or plastic build-up can decrease their efficiency or even damage them.

Both fans should be checked and cleaned after a few hundred hours of printing. With the fan **not** moving, dust can be removed with compressed air in a spray can, small plastic threads can be removed with tweezers.

Do not blow compressed air on a running fan: the fan can get damaged this way.

### Nextruder

When accessing the extruder parts, do not open the gearbox: this action can cause issues on the extrusion, and will

**void the printer warranty**

.

The primary gear and the bearings attached to the Idler Shaft in the extruder do not need any lubricant. Over time, a deposit of filament debris can form in the grooves of the primary gear, which then causes insufficient filament extrusion. Access the extruder by lifting the Idler Nut, and then moving the Idle Shaft. You can blow away the dirt with compressed air, or use a brass brush or an ordinary toothpick. Use the access hole on the side of the extruder.

### Heaterblock

**CAUTION**

: Heated parts can cause severe burns!

In case the heaterblock is covered with plastic, it can affect its thermal properties. To clean it, heat the nozzle for 3 to 5 minutes at 250 °C, and **turn the printer off**. Immediately after that use a small brass brush to clear away any old plastic stuck on the nozzle and heaterblock. Be extra careful around the fragile wires that join the heaterblock.

### Electronics

Every ~600-800 printing hours access the electronic boards for a visual check.

Before touching the electrical connections, please make sure that the printer is

**fully cooled down**

,

**switched off**

, and

**unplugged from the main power source for at least 10 minutes**

.

* Check if there are any pinched or worn cables on the printer.
* Access the electronic boards and blow compressed air in between the cables to get rid of dust.
* Check the connection of all of the wires on the electronic boards.



### Firmware and software

You should always be using the latest **stable** firmware version that we have published for your specific printer model. You can check the firmware version you have, by navigating to _LCD menu - Info - Version info_.

We also recommend using the latest version of our [PrusaSlicer](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/install-prusaslicer_1903), as it enables you to **enjoy all the features** of your printer. It even saves information about the printer model, nozzle diameter, and firmware version directly into the g-code file so that the printer can warn you if anything is out of date or incompatible.

# [Tune menu (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tune-menu-xl_401245)

Starting accidentally another action during the print (e.g. XYZ calibration, switching sheet profiles) can cause damage to the printer. This is why during the entire printing phase most of the menu items are unavailable. The safety of the user and the printer is the biggest priority.

However, some information can be shown, and some parameters can be adjusted (e.g. temperatures, flow, sound mode) and those are shown in a special list called " **Tune menu** ". Below is a list of items from the Tune menu on the Original Prusa XL:

# [Loadcell (XL, MK4)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/loadcell-xl-mk4_401253)

The Original Prusa XL and the Original Prusa MK4 are equipped with a **loadcell**. This component incorporated in the hotend heatsink detects if the nozzle is close enough to the steel sheet for printing.

The only adjustment needed for the **loadcell** is during the Selftest. After that, the first layer calibration is always done automatically during the **mesh bed leveling**. This avoids any damage that would be caused by the nozzle digging into the steel sheet.

The manual first layer calibration (Live Z adjust) and the steel sheet profiles are not necessary with the **loadcell** , as the values are checked automatically before each print.

### Testing the loadcell

Do not manipulate or touch the printer unless the instructions on the printer screen prompt you to do so.

During the Selftest, the loadcell will be tested: the printer will show the instructions for testing it.

Alternatively, the loadcell testing can be initiated in _LCD Menu - > Control -> Calibration & Tests -> Loadcell Test _on the **XL** , or in _LCD Menu - > Calibration -> Diagnostics ->Test Loadcell _on the **MK4**.

During the test, you will be asked to tap the nozzle at a specific time, and a progress bar on top of the screen will be filled. If the bar is not filled or the printer shows any errors, please contact our [customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287).

---

# [Selftest failed (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-failed-xl_401278)

On the Original Prusa XL, the **selftest** checks for issues in the assembly of the printer, its wiring and the electronic components. It is the first part of the Calibration Wizard, which is prompted automatically when you turn on the printer for the first time or after a Factory reset (XL). After the initial calibration is completed, the selftest can be initiated in _LCD Menu - Calibration - Selftest_.

During the selftest, do not manipulate or touch the printer, unless the printer prompts an action with instructions on the display.

If the printer is placed on an unstable surface or if there is another running 3D printer next to it, it may affect the accuracy of the calibration negatively. The printer should be placed on a stable surface.

### Selftest procedure checks

* Test of the extruder and the print fan
* Test of the X, Y, and Z axis
* Proper connection of the heated bed and the hotend
* Loadcell test
* Setting up the filament sensor



### Selftest results

During the selftest, its results are shown on the screen, indicating success or fail for each point. Alterantively, the results can be shown at any time on the following path: _LCD Menu - Calibrate - Diagnostics - Show selftest results_.

### Selftest errors

#### Test of the extruder and the print fan

The Original Prusa XL selftest procedure can determine which of the fans doesn't work. Check the one that is diagnosed as **not OK**.

* Make sure that both of your fans are correctly connected to the Dwarf board.
* Check for any blockage that could prevent either of the fans from spinning.



#### Test of the X, Y, and Z axis

The printer can determine if the components are moving correctly along each axis.

In case of an issue on the X-axis, or on the Y-axis, make sure that there is no obstacle to the movement, and [readjust the belt tension](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-xl_401793).

#### Proper connection of the heated bed and the hotend

The selftest can determine a fault during the heating of a component, and the affected component.

Heat up the affected component in [LCD Menu - Settings - Preheat], and see if any error appears: if it does, the error should have a QR code that redirects to the article that describes how to troubleshoot that particular error.

Contact our

[customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287)

if you are on a different case, or in case of any doubts.

#### Loadcell test

A functioning **loadcell** is fundamental for the Original Prusa XL to detect that the nozzle is close enough to the steel sheet for printing, and to avoid damage that would be caused by the nozzle digging into the steel sheet.

* Make sure that the loadcell is correctly connected to the Dwarf board.
* Make sure that the surface the printer is on is as stable as possible: any form of vibration propagated to the surface under the printer, or a not fully stable surface under the printer, might cause a false reading on the loadcell, causing it to fail the selftest.



#### Filament sensor

The Original Prusa XL is equipped with **two filament sensors** : the first one is located on the side, close to the input of the PTFE tube where you feed the filament. The second one is located in the extruder. Both filament sensors are necessary for the correct filament retraction: when the sensor on the side detects that the filament has run out, the filament will be retracted in time.

* Make sure that the extruder filament sensor is correctly connected to the Dwarf board.
* Make sure that the side filament sensor is correctly connected.

# [Filament not loading (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-not-loading-xl_401286)

If the filament is not loaded into the extruder, yet the printer is trying to pull the filament inside, there might be a hardware problem in some of the extruder components: we will examine the causes and fixes in this article.

### Retry procedure

After an attempt at loading filament, the printer will prompt a screen, where it is asked if the filament color is correct. If the filament is not oozing from the nozzle at this stage, push the filament towards the extruder, and after that, select "retry".

### Idler tension screws

The extruder includes two idler tension screws, to set the correct distance between the drive gear and the two driven gears. These are set to the optimal position at the factory. In case of an intervention on that component, it will be necessary to adjust the idler tension screws to their optimal position: the tips of the screws must be aligned with the front surface of the Idler Nut. After that, close the Idler Block.

### Clogged hotend

# [Clogged hotend (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-hotend-xl_401294)

A clogged nozzle or hotend is a common issue for FFF/FDM printers. If there are no issues, the filament is pushed in the hotend, melted, and then extruded through the nozzle. However, if the nozzle is damaged or there are impurities in the filament it might get stuck in the hotend, clogging the printer.

### How to spot clogged nozzle/hotend?

#### Visual check

* Is the filament reaching the nozzle? Check if the filament goes past the Nextruder gear.
* Is the filament coming out of the nozzle? Pay attention when loading the filament.
* Partial clog - gaps and missing layers
* Partial clog - filament curling up and sticking to the nozzle



#### Soundcheck

Check if there are clicking noises from the extruder

* If there is a loud clicking noise, this most likely suggests the nozzle is clogged or deformed
* If there is a light clicking noise, this can most likely point to the gearing



#### Partial clog

Sometimes the clog is partial, meaning that the printer is able to push some filament through, but it is not enough to print the object properly, leading to visible gaps and missing layers. An early sign of a clogged nozzle is that the filament is not extruded consistently, curls up, and sticks to the nozzle.

#### Extruder clicking

The hotend or the nozzle is partially or fully clogged and the internal resistance against the flow of the filament is greater than what the gears are able to push. As a result, the gears are skipping leading to the “clicking” noise and in most scenarios also to the grinding of the filament.

### How to fix the clogged printer?

Choosing the right method depends on whether **you are able to at least partially load/unload the filament or whether the printer is fully jammed** and refusing the move the filament even a little.

Before you start fixing the printer, try unloading the filament and removing it completely. If you are unable to do it, it might indicate a more serious problem, but we will deal with this one as well.

Also, move the heatbed downwards from _LCD Menu - Control - Move Axis - Z-axis_ or by long-pressing the control knob, this way you will get better access to the parts that are clogged.

#### Extruder idler screws

The extruder includes two idler tension screws, to set the correct distance between the drive gear and the two driven gears. These are set to the optimal position at the factory. In case of an intervention on that part, you can adjust the idler tension screws to their optimal position: the tips of the screws must be aligned with the front surface of the Idler Nut. After that, close the Idler Block.

#### Gears

Over time, a deposit of filament debris can form in the grooves of the feeding gear, which then causes insufficient filament extrusion. Access the extruder by lifting the Idler Nut, and then moving the Idle Shaft. You can blow away the dirt with compressed air, or use a brass brush or an ordinary toothpick. Use the access hole on the side of the extruder.

#### Nozzle

**Do not touch the hotend while the printer is at a hot temperature.** **Heated parts can cause severe burns!**

Follow these steps to clean the nozzle:

1. Heat the nozzle to the appropriate temperature according to the filament material you will be printing from. First, introduce the filament, then insert an **acupuncture needle** (included in the package) or a thin wire (0.3-0.35 mm) into the nozzle from below to a depth of approximately 1-2 cm. **Use protective gloves if material suddenly starts to flow from the nozzle**.
2. Select the Load Filament option from the LCD menu and check that the nozzle is actually pushing the filament.
3. Insert the wire or acupuncture needle into the nozzle again and repeat the whole procedure several times. If the filament is extruded correctly, the nozzle is clean.

# [Adjusting belt tension (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-xl_401793)

On the Original Prusa XL, adjusting the belt to the optimal tension is crucial to achieving good quality on the prints. A loose belt can cause [Layer shifting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layer-shifting_2020), [Ghosting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ghosting_1801), or other print abnormalities, like getting an irregular shape instead of a perfect circle. An over-tightened belt can cause an irregular movement in the X and Y axes.

The Original Prusa XL geometry is **CoreXY** : it has two belts for the X-axis.

### Belt tuner

We have our own [belt tuner](https://belt.connect.prusa3d.com/). The application determines the belt tension by measuring the frequency of the vibration generated by strumming it. Follow the instructions in the video below to adjust the belt.

Once you tighten the belt on both sides, ensure that the two sides are perfectly aligned. If needed, follow the steps in the

[alignment](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-xl_401793#Alignment)

paragraph to fully align the two sides.

### Homing tower

We prepared a specific [homing tower](https://www.printables.com/model/542670-homing-tower), to visualize possible issues with the belt tension and have the possibility to correct them on the spot.

In case the **belt is loose** , the tower will have an inconsistent finish, with scattered material on the walls instead of a smooth finish. Without interrupting the print, tighten the screws on both Y-axis rails by half turn.

If the print finish does not fully improve, repeat the procedure once again, until the homing tower has a **smooth, consistent finish**.

An over-tightened belt can result in **layer shifting**.

Once the tower has a smooth finish, loosen the same screws very slightly, and observe if this further improves the tower. Repeat the procedure until the tower has an ideal finish.

### Alignment

It is crucial to have perfect alignment between the right and left sides.

Tightening the right Y-axis rail reduces the space between the CoreXY Front Left and the X-axis on the right side but creates space on the left side, and vice versa.

Move the X-axis all the way to the front of the printer, and move the X-carriage with the extruder all the way to the left.

Test the alignment by squeezing the CoreXY Front Left and the X-axis on either side: there should be no play between the parts. If there is play, tighten the screw on the same side slightly, move the X-axis assembly back and all the way to the front, and test the alignment again on both sides.

Repeat the same procedure until both sides are perfectly aligned and without any play. Once at this stage, check the belt tension once again using the belt tuner app. Both belts need to be at the same tension, and at the same time, the X-axis has to be aligned.

In case there is a difference on the test, slightly tighten the screw on the side:

* tighten the right side to tension the upper belt as seen from the front.
* tighten the left side to tension the lower belt as seen from the front.

# [Heatbreak Mintemp error #17211 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/heatbreak-mintemp-error-17211-xl_403756)

### What happened?

The printer will display the message **"Check the heatbreak thermistor wiring for possible damage"** if the heatbreak temperature measures less than 5 °C at any point. In this case, the printer will stop the heating and display the message on the screen.

Error name: Heatbreak Mintemp error

Most often, this error happens due to wiring damage or connection issue on the heatbreak thermistor cable.

### How to fix it?

#### A visual inspection

Check the Dwarf board where the heatbreak thermistor resides, to ensure that no wires have broken off or are disconnected.

Before you start, make sure:

* the filament is unloaded from the extruder
* the printer is turned OFF and unplugged from electricity
* the hotend and the heatbed are cooled down to ambient temperature



Since we will handle tools and work with the extruder high above the heatbed, it is necessary to protect it.

Place an empty Prusament cardboard box approximately to the front center part of the heated. Move the X-axis all the way to the front side of the printer, and move the extruder approximately to the center of the X-axis.

Open the dwarf-cover-door to access the Dwarf board. Check that all the connectors are secure in their sockets, according to the picture below. Focus on the heatbreak thermistor cable. Though unlikely, rough shipping or handling could have shaken the heatbreak thermistor cable loose.

# [BBF Allocation Failed #17531 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/bbf-allocation-failed-17531-xl_403959)

### What happened?

The Original Prusa XL firmware is in **BBF** format. When flashing firmware, this is copied from the USB drive to the XL internal memory. In case of an issue in allocating the internal space for the firmware file, the printer will show the message **"Space allocation for firmware BBF file failed. Repeat the action or try another USB drive."**

Error name: BBF Allocation Failed

### How to fix it?

#### Re-flash firmware

[Download the firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads) and if necessary the bootloader, and transfer it to your USB drive. Make sure to unmount the drive from your operating system before physically removing it.

Insert the USB drive back into the printer and reboot the printer using the reset button directly next to the knob to initiate the flashing procedure. In case the procedure does not start, reboot the printer again by pressing the same reset button, and while the printer is booting up, press once the rotating knob.

The printer will let you know when the flashing is done. When installing the bootloader along with the firmware, it may take several minutes.

#### Use another USB drive

If the issue persists, attempt flashing firmware using any other USB drive in your household: make sure this is [formatted to FAT32](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sd-cards-and-usb-drives_112291#how-do-i-format-the-usb-drive-sd-card), copy both firmware files, and repeat the previously described procedure.

**WARNING: The hotend and heatbed are very HOT. Do not touch these parts!!!**

For the following steps, it is necessary to have the heaterblock and the hotend clean from the remains of the filament. Otherwise, it can be difficult to release the nozzle.

If you have a Prusa hotend sock on the hotend, remove it.

- On the printer screen, go to _Preheat_ and select the latest used material. (e.g. ABS)

- Wait at least 5 minutes. The remains of the filament must be warmed up slightly so that they can be removed more easily.

- Using the brass brush, carefully clean the heaterblock and the hotend from the filament residue. **Avoid contact of the brush with the hotend cables, as this could cause a short circuit.**

- When the heaterblock and the hotend are perfectly clean, cool down the printer. On the screen, navigate to _Preheat - > Cooldown_.

**Wait until the hot parts are cooled down**

to ambient temperature. It takes approximately 10 minutes.

# [How to replace the Prusa Nozzle (XL single-tool)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-the-prusa-nozzle-xl-single-tool_405846)

**WARNING: The hotend and heatbed are very HOT. Do not touch these parts!!!**

For the following steps, it is necessary to have the heaterblock and the hotend clean from the remains of the filament. Otherwise, it can be difficult to release the nozzle.

If you have a Prusa hotend sock on the hotend, remove it.

- On the printer screen, go to _Preheat_ and select the latest used material. (e.g. ABS)

- Wait at least 5 minutes. The remains of the filament must be warmed up slightly so that they can be removed more easily.

- Using the brass brush, carefully clean the heaterblock and the hotend from the filament residue. **Avoid contact of the brush with the hotend cables, as this could cause a short circuit.**

- When the heaterblock and the hotend are perfectly clean, cool down the printer. On the screen, navigate to _Preheat - > Cooldown_.

**Wait until the hot parts are cooled down**

to ambient temperature. It takes approximately 10 minutes.

# [Blown Fuse (MK4)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk4_411666)

The Original Prusa MK4 series is equipped with a 24V xBuddy mainboard. This 32-bit logic board has three removable automotive fuses protecting the crucial components. If your printer or some of its components suddenly stopped working, it is recommended to check these fuses and replace them if necessary.

#### Each fuse protects a different part of the board:

* **F1 (10A fuse)** : Heatbed heating
* _**F2 (5A fuse)** : _Motors + logic unit + fans
* _**F3 (5A fuse)** : _Extruder heater



### Checking the fuses

Before checking the fuses, turn the printer off and disconnect the power cord.

Open the xBuddyBox-cover and the el-box-cover by opening the screws indicated below. Then pull out the fuses and inspect them.

If you own a multimeter, you can check the components for a potential short.

[Multimeter usage](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117)

will show you how.

### PSU fuse

The MK4 PSU uses an **F8AH250V 20mm fuse (fast)**. You can check the pictures below for how to find the fuse in your PSU.

When you are replacing the fuse, make sure that the printer is turned off and disconnected from the power source.

* **Find the PSU fuse** , which is located just above the PSU's power plug.
* **Remove the cover of the PSU fuse** , the best tool for that is the screwdriver that comes bundled with our printer.
* **Inspect if the wire inside of the fuse is intact**. If it is damaged, then it must be replaced.



### Replacing blown fuses

If you find out that any of the fuses are blown, you can easily replace them. The fuses can be found at any local car parts/hardware store or ordered online. It's a good practice to bring the blown fuse with you so that you can get the exact same one.

1. **Turn the printer off, disconnect the power,** and remove the blown fuse(s) from their sockets.
2. Place the new fuse in the correct slot - **Double-check that you are replacing 5A for 5A or 15A for 15A if changing it on the xBuddy**.
3. **Unplug any components** connected to the previously blown fuse and try to turn on your printer. Check for any kind of unwanted behavior.
4. Once again, turn off the printer and remove the power cord. Then **reconnect all the disconnected components**.

# [Filament not loading (MK4)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-not-loading-mk4_411680)

If the filament is not loaded into the extruder, yet the printer is trying to pull the filament inside, there might be a hardware problem in some of the extruder components: we will examine the causes and fixes in this article.

### Filament tip

Ensure that the filament tip is cut at an approximate 45 degrees angle. The printer might struggle to load filament otherwise.

### Retry procedure

After an attempt at loading filament, the printer will prompt a screen, where it is asked if the filament color is correct. If the filament is not oozing from the nozzle at this stage, push the filament towards the extruder, and after that, select "retry".

### Idler tension screws

The extruder includes two idler tension screws, to set the correct distance between the drive gear and the two driven gears. These are set to the optimal position at the factory. In case of an intervention on that component, it will be necessary to adjust the idler tension screws to their optimal position: the tips of the screws must be aligned with the front surface of the Idler Nut. After that, close the Idler Block.

### Clogged hotend

# [Clogged hotend (MK4)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-hotend-mk4_411823)

A clogged nozzle or hotend is a common issue for FFF/FDM printers. If there are no issues, the filament is pushed in the hotend, melted, and then extruded through the nozzle. However, if the nozzle is damaged or there are impurities in the filament it might get stuck in the hotend, clogging the printer.

### How to spot clogged nozzle/hotend?

#### Visual check

* Is the filament reaching the nozzle? Check if the filament goes past the Nextruder gear.
* Is the filament coming out of the nozzle? Pay attention when loading the filament.
* Partial clog - gaps and missing layers
* Partial clog - filament curling up and sticking to the nozzle



#### Soundcheck

Check if there are clicking noises from the extruder

* If there is a loud clicking noise, this most likely suggests the nozzle is clogged or deformed
* If there is a light clicking noise, this can most likely point to the gearing



#### Partial clog

Sometimes the clog is partial, meaning that the printer is able to push some filament through, but it is not enough to print the object properly, leading to visible gaps and missing layers. An early sign of a clogged nozzle is that the filament is not extruded consistently, curls up, and sticks to the nozzle.

#### Extruder clicking

The hotend or the nozzle is partially or fully clogged and the internal resistance against the flow of the filament is greater than what the gears are able to push. As a result, the gears are skipping leading to the “clicking” noise and in most scenarios also to the grinding of the filament.

### How to fix the clogged printer?

Choosing the right method depends on whether **you are able to at least partially load/unload the filament or whether the printer is fully jammed** and refusing the move the filament even a little.

Before you start fixing the printer, try unloading the filament and removing it completely. If you are unable to do it, it might indicate a more serious problem, but we will deal with this one as well.

Also, move the extruder upwards from _LCD Menu - Settings - Move Axis - Z-axis_ or by long-pressing the control knob, this way you will get better access to the parts that are clogged.

#### Extruder idler screws

The extruder includes two idler tension screws, to set the correct distance between the drive gear and the two driven gears. These are set to the optimal position at the factory. In case of an intervention on that part, you can adjust the idler tension screws to their optimal position: the tips of the screws must be aligned with the front surface of the Idler Nut. After that, close the Idler Block.

#### Gears

Over time, a deposit of filament debris can form in the grooves of the feeding gear, which then causes insufficient filament extrusion. Access the extruder by lifting the Idler Nut, and then moving the Idle Shaft. You can blow away the dirt with compressed air, or use a brass brush or an ordinary toothpick. Use the access hole on the side of the extruder.

#### Nozzle

**Do not touch the hotend while the printer is at a hot temperature.** **Heated parts can cause severe burns!**

Follow these steps to clean the nozzle:

1. Heat the nozzle to the appropriate temperature according to the filament material you will be printing from. First, introduce the filament, then insert an **acupuncture needle** (included in the package) or a thin wire (0.3-0.35 mm) into the nozzle from below to a depth of approximately 1-2 cm. **Use protective gloves if material suddenly starts to flow from the nozzle**.
2. Select the Load Filament option from the LCD menu and check that the nozzle is actually pushing the filament.
3. Insert the wire or acupuncture needle into the nozzle again and repeat the whole procedure several times. If the filament is extruded correctly, the nozzle is clean.

Make sure there are no obstructions in the path of the X-axis. For example, there might be a piece of filament stuck around the belt, or on a smooth rod, from a previous print.

#### X-axis belt tension

Check the X-axis belt tension and adjust it, following our [dedicated article on belt adjustment](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mk3-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5-mk4_112380).

#### X-axis motor pulley

The X-axis motor pulley is attached to the X-axis motor shaft. The motor shaft has one flat side. The pulley has two set screws: ensure that one of the two set screws is aligned with the flat part of the motor shaft. Make sure the other set screw is also tightened, not excessively, and that there is a small space between the pulley and the motor.

#### X-carriage assembly

An over-tightened or loose X-carriage and X-carriage-clip assembly might cause the error. If none of the previous steps resolved the issue, refer to our [assembly manual](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-x-axis-x-carriage-assembly_429986) to see the assembly of the X-carriage and X-carriage-clip.

#### xBuddy connection

Check the motor connections on the board. For that, open the four screws that hold the xBuddy box cover. Make sure that the motor connector is not loose, and that the X-axis motor connector has not been accidentally switched with the Y-axis motor or any other motor.

### What happened?

The Original Prusa MK4/MK3.9/MK3.5 displays the message: **"Failed to home the Y-axis, make sure there is no obstacle on Y-axis** ".

Error name: Homing error Y

Error code: #13305 (MK4) #21305 (MK3.9) #23305 (MK3.5)

The error is most likely caused by a bad movement of the Y-carriage along the Y-axis.

### How to fix it?

#### Y-axis movement

Make sure there are no obstructions in the path of the Y-axis. For example, there might be a piece of filament stuck around the belt, or on a smooth rod, from a previous print.

#### Y-axis belt tension

Check the Y-axis belt tension and adjust it, following our [dedicated article on belt adjustment](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mk3-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5-mk4_112380).

#### Y-axis motor pulley

The Y-axis motor pulley is attached to the Y-axis motor shaft. The motor shaft has one flat side. The pulley has two set screws, ensure that one of the two set screws is aligned with the flat part of the motor shaft. Make sure the other set screw is also tightened, not excessively, and that there is a small space between the pulley and the motor.

#### Y-axis bearings position

Incorrect positioning of the bearings might cause the error.

On the side of the Y-carriage with one bearing, ensure that the bearing is centered on the bearing clip. Approximately the same piece of bearing should be visible on each side.

On the side of the Y-carriage with two bearings, place the bearings as close to the center of the Y-carriage as possible. Beware, the bearings must not touch the edge of the pocket!

If you are correcting the position of the bearings, make sure to keep the correct orientation. The tracks (rows of balls) have to be on the sides.

#### xBuddy connection

Check the motor connections on the board. For that, open the four screws that hold the xBuddy box cover. Make sure that the motor connector is not loose, and that the Y-axis motor connector has not been accidentally switched with the X-axis motor or any other motor.

# [Selftest Failed (MK4)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-failed-mk4_417808)

When you first turn on your Original Prusa MK4 printer, it will start a selftest to verify the most common components of the printer.

Make sure that your Firmware is always up to date in our

[Downloads page](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads)

### What it tests

The printer goes through the following procedures:

* **Hotend fan check**
* **Print fan check**
* **Switched fans check**
* **Loadcell test**
* **X-axis check**
* **Y-axis check**
* **Z-axis check**
* **Nozzle heater check**
* **Heatbed heater check**
* **Gearbox alignment**
* **Filament sensor test**



The Loadcell test, Gearbox alignment, and Filament sensor test need user input, so stay near the printer for these parts of the selftest.

After the selftest, you can check the results at any time in the printer menu in _Control - > Diagnostics -> Show Selftest Result_.

### Troubleshooting

#### Fans

In case one of the fans fails the selftest, verify if there is nothing blocking the rotation of the fans, as debris might get between the blades. Bigger parts can be cleared with tweezers, and dust can be cleared with a computer cleaner spray.

Hold the fan with your hand while using the compressed air. Otherwise, you might damage the blades.

In case the fan is clean and the issue persists, open the LoveBoard cover and the fan door, and check the connection **print fan** or the **heatsink fan**. Make sure that they are in the correct slot.

#### Loadcell

During the **Loadcell test** , you will be asked to tap the nozzle at a specific time. In case you do not tap the nozzle, the printer will restart the loadcell test.

If the Loadcell is being triggered too soon, make sure that you are not touching any other part of the extruder other than the nozzle.

This test can be skipped, but skipping it can cause the nozzle to damage your steel sheet and heatbed.

Only touch the nozzle when the selftest requires you to. Touching it at other times may cause burns.

#### X/Y Axes

In the case of a failure in the X or Y axis, check the following:

* Make sure that nothing is blocking the axis path.
* Turn off the printer and move the axis by hand. It should be moved easily.
* Check the belt pulleys on the Y or X motor shaft. One of the set screws must be firmly **tightened over the flat part of the motor shaft** , there should be a small **gap between the motor and the pulley** , and they need to be in the **correct orientation and position** (shown below).
* Check if the belts aren't extremely loose, as they might skip on the teeth of the belt pulley.
* Try to clean, then apply lubricant to the smooth rods.
* Check if the M3x30 screw that holds the fan door is firmly tightened.



Correct **X-axis** pulley orientation and position.Correct **X-axis** pulley orientation and position.
Correct **Y-axis** pulley orientation and position.Correct **Y-axis** pulley orientation and position.

The fan door screw must be tightened fully

#### Z-axis

The Z-axis check will not be made if the Loadcell test is skipped.

In case the Z-axis test does not pass, check the direction of the trapezoid nut. Make sure that the hotend is properly positioned in the Nextruder.

#### Nozzle/heatbed heater

After the filament sensor test, the selftest will heat up the nozzle and the heatbed to test them. The steel sheet needs to be on the heatbed for this test.

In case you get any errors, scan the QR code shown on the screen, or check our [Knowledgebase](https://help.prusa3d.com/).

In case you have a [Prusa Nextruder Silicone](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-nextruder-silicone-sock-set/), go in the printer menu to Settings -> Hardware -> Nextruder silicon sock, and toggle it ON.

#### Filament sensor

If the filament sensor does not detect the filament during the selftest, you can check the LoveBoard to see if the cable is properly connected. Also, make sure that there is no debris in the Prusa ball holder.

It is possible to skip this part of the selftest, but in this case, the features that depend on the filament sensor might not work.

If you open the filament sensor mechanism in the hotend, note that there are very small parts in it that may be lost!

# [Status LED explained (MK4/XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/status-led-explained-mk4-xl_418975)

Selected Original Prusa printers are equipped with status LEDs located on the lower edge of the LCD screen. Together there are three physical RGB LEDs. The system will change their color and intensity based on the current scenario. The purpose of this system is to provide helpful visual information to the user.

To ensure the LEDs are visible even from a longer distance. Make sure there is a solid, reflective surface under the front edge of the LCD screen.

### Compatible printers:

* Original Prusa MK4
* Original Prusa XL



### There are several pre-defined scenarios for the LEDs:

* **Successful boot**
* **Scenario:** The boot of the system was assessed as successful.
* **LED response:** The LEDs will pulse shortly with a **green color.**
* **Warning**
* **Scenario:** The printer requires user interaction and then can continue to print (e.g. planned filament change, filament runout, pause in G-code, MMU requires attention, etc.)
* **LED response:** The LEDs will pulse in **yellow color**.
* **Critical error**
* **Scenario:** There is a serious error, and the print job cannot continue. The printer must be fixed in order to work correctly (e.g. Thermal runaway, Preheat error, Max/Min temp, ...)
* **LED response:** The LEDs will pulse in **red color**.
* **The print job is in progress**
* **Scenario:** The printer is currently in the progress of printing the selected G-code.
* **LED response:** The LEDs are switched to **blue color**.
* **The print job is done**
* **Scenario:** The current print job has finished successfully, the print head is parked and the printer is awaiting the user, to collect the printed object. Please note that the **sheet might be still hot!** Avoid harming yourself **** and also give the surface a few moments to cool down to allow easier detachment of the print.
* **LED response:** The LEDs are switched to **green color**.



### Use-defined LED statuses

LEDs can be controlled using a G-code M150, you can learn more about it at [Marlin FW site](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M150.html).

# [Regular printer maintenance (MK4)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/regular-printer-maintenance-mk4_419000)

It is recommended to take some time to maintain your Original Prusa MK4 regularly. This should be done even if the printer is working perfectly.

Besides the usual tools, such as Allen keys, needle-nose pliers, and IPA (Isopropyl Alcohol) + paper towels, you might need:

* **Compressed air** : also known as canned air. Be sure to not hold it upside down while spraying - otherwise, you could damage any electronic components while trying to clean them.
* **Brush** : a small brass brush is useful for cleaning the heaterblock. If you don't have a brass brush any brush with hard bristles will do the job.
* **Prusa Lubricant** : a tube of Prusa Lubricant is included with the Original Prusa MK4. It is used for lubricating the smooth rods and linear bearings.



**Do not apply lubricant on the trapezoid nuts or the threaded lead screws of the Z-axis!**

### Frequent maintenance

The following points should be checked before every print.

#### Keeping the printer clean

After several hours of printing, various kinds of debris may start to accumulate around the printer parts or under the heatbed - pieces of filament, dust, scraps, broken supports, etc. Always make sure that the parts of the printer are clean. You can use a brush, a small broom, or a vacuum to remove debris.

#### Flexible steel sheet

Acetone should be used sparingly for cleaning, and only be used on the Smooth steel sheet!

**Never use acetone on the Textured or Satin steel sheet**

as the surface will be permanently damaged.

Never clean the special [**PA Nylon sheet**](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/special-pa-nylon-steel-sheet_341570) with acetone, IPA (isopropyl alcohol), or other alcohol-based solvents (window cleaners, Windex, etc.)! This will damage the surface.

All flexible steel sheets should be cleaned regularly to ensure adhesion, but the exact methods and washing solutions can differ depending on your type of sheet.

You can find more information on how to take care of your flexible steel sheet [in this article](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/flexible-steel-sheets-guidepost_2195).

### Sporadic maintenance

The following checks should be done every 200 hours of printing time.

#### Axes check

* **Smooth rods** : scratches/grooves - take each rod between two/three fingers and move them slowly from one end of the rod to another, while rotating the fingers around the rod. If you notice any scratch, verify it with your fingernail.
* **Smooth rods and Bearings** : Clean the smooth rods with a clean paper towel, and lubricate them using a small amount of Prusa Lubricant.
Only in case you feel the axis is not running smoothly anymore even after recently cleaning and lubricating the smooth rods, bearings can be taken out, cleaned with alcohol, and greased on the inside, still using a small amount of Prusa Lubricant.
* **Belt pulleys** : any debris around the belt pulleys and belts should be immediately removed to ensure smooth operations. Also, check if the set screw of the belt pulley is firmly secured on the flat side of the motor shaft.
* **Belts** : Both of the belts should be tight enough to sound like a low bass note when plucked.



#### Fans

The RPM (revolutions per minute) of both fans is constantly measured. This means that the printer will report an error if the fan suddenly slows down, for example, due to a piece of filament stuck in it.

In such a case, check and remove any dirt from the relevant fan. **Do not try to bypass the RPM check, as this could damage the printer!**

Both fans should be checked and cleaned after every few hundred hours of printing. Dust can be removed with compressed air in a spray can, small plastic threads can be removed with tweezers.

Do not blow compressed air on the running fan.

#### Nextruder

When accessing the extruder parts, avoid opening the gearbox, unless our official

[technical support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287)

asks for it. In case you need to open the gearbox, make sure that you have the

[Assembly Adapter](https://www.printables.com/model/451501-mk4-printable-parts/files)

printed so it can be re-assembled correctly.

The primary gear and the bearings attached to the Idler Shaft in the extruder do not need any lubricant. Over time, a deposit of filament debris can form in the grooves of the primary gear, which then causes insufficient filament extrusion. Access the extruder by lifting the Idler Nut, and then moving the Idler Shaft. You can blow away the dirt with compressed air, or use a brass brush or an ordinary toothpick. Use the access hole on the side of the extruder.

### Annual maintenance

#### Electronics

It is a good practice to check and optionally reconnect the electrical connectors on the xBuddy board and electronics board in the Nextruder every 600-800 hours of printing.

# [Factory reset (MK4/XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mk4-xl_421206)

During normal function, your printer saves statistics, calibration data, and personalized settings, even after it is turned off. If you feel like you changed settings that have negatively affected your 3D printer, you can always revert to factory default values and try again.

Doing a factory reset will clear statistics data, like total printing time and filament use.

### How to factory reset

Factory Reset can be done via _LCD Menu - > Settings -> System -> Factory Reset_.

Starting firmware 4.6.1 there are two options:

* **Reset Settings & Calibrations** \- this option deletes all changes done by the user and reverts the system to its original state. For most of the cases, this is a sufficient method. Technically speaking only the EEPROM with user stored data is deleted. Once, the reset is done, the printer will boot to language selection, followed by the calibration wizard.
* **Hard reset (USB with FW needed)** \- due to the complex partition layout, the firmware is storing its settings not only in the EEPROM but also on the XFLASH. In some edge cases, it might be necessary to delete both of these. Once this reset is done, the user has to insert a USB drive with firmware as some parts of the XFLASH have to be created again from scratch.



### Flashing firmware

If you are seeing any inconsistent behavior we recommend also flashing the firmware. A factory reset followed by flashing the firmware and recalibrating will resolve most firmware issues you may encounter.

# [2. Base & Side frame assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-side-frame-assembly_422967)

The protrusions are designed with an overlap to ensure strength and accuracy when tightened properly.

- Turn the right side (no sticker) of the base towards you. Use the extrusion plastic cap as a guide.

- Make sure one profile insert is slid all the way to the back.

**Be careful while connecting extrusions together, avoid scratching them**

. The orientation of the silver pin doesn't matter.

- Before you connect the extrusions together, see the protrusion in the "standalone" extrusion. This part must be aligned with the "groove" in the base extrusion. See the bubble in the third picture.

- Take one rear extrusion prepared earlier and slide its pin into the profile insert. Mind the correct orientation of the extrusion (protrusion vs groove).

- There might be a slight gap between parts, we will address this in the next step.

# [3. CoreXY & Back assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-corexy-back-assembly_422975)

-  **Are you left or right-handed?** The printer should be already laying on its left side from the previous chapter. If you are a left-hander rotate it carefully on the opposite right side (see the picture). We are going to attach the upper CoreXY part and tighten the screws to interconnect both parts together. The instructions are the same, **choose the side which suits you better for tightening the screws** _._

It is recommended to place a cardboard pad under the side of the base to protect the work bench and the frame from scratch.

- There's a hole in the extrusion that the pin has to fit into.

- Move the rear profile insert inside each extrusion of the CoreXY to the rear side of the assembly.

- Slide the remaining inserts approximately to the middle. Precise position will be addressed later.

- Rotate the CoreXY on its longer side and put it near the top of the four base extrusions.

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_426859)

- 3D printed parts are very precise, however, there still might be a tolerance in the printed part and same goes for the size of the nut.

- Therefore it might happen, that the nut won't fit easily in or might be falling out. Let's see, how to fix it:

-  **Nut won't fit in** : use a screw with a thread along its entire length (typically: M3x10, M3x18) and screw it from the opposite side of the opening. While tightening the screw, the nut will be pulled in. Remove the screw afterwards.

-  **Alternative option:** you can use X-holder tool included in the package. Insert any screw (typically: M3x10 or M3x18) and screw the nut fully on the tip of the thread. Push the nut into the printed part and remove the screw with X-holder.

-  **Nut keeps falling out** : Use a piece of tape to fix the nut temporarily in place, as soon as you insert the screw in, you can remove the tape. _Using glue isn't recommended as it can partly reach into the thread and you won't be able to tighten the screw properly._

- Every time we recommend to use the "screw pulling technique", you will be reminded with Joe's avatar ;)

Parts in the pictures are used as an example.

# [2. Frame assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-frame-assembly_427481)

- Now have a look at the frame from the front side. Verify the PSU is on the right back side of the frame when looking from the front.

- Insert M4x10r screws into the holes in the frame, towards the front of the PSU.

- Adjust the position of the PSU, there are holes in the PSU's case, which must align with the holes in the frame. By default the PSU sits slightly lower than needed, pull it up little bit. until the M4 screws are able to catch the thread in the PSU.

- Make sure the PSU is pressed against both the frame and the extrusion on the bottom.

-  **Turn the tube and applicator counterclockwise** until you feel a slight resistance. This means that the holes in the applicator are aligned with the ball rows.

- Gently press the tube to push the lubricant into the ball rows of the bearing.

- Remove the bearing from the applicator and look at the amount applied inside. Take a look at the third picture, which shows a sufficient amount of lubricant inside the bearing.

The

**grease** **must be spread evenly over all four ball rows**

inside the bearing.

**There must not be too much grease**

, a thin layer is enough. Take a closer look at the last picture.

-  **Proceed the same from the opposite side of the bearing. The lubricant in the LM10LUU bearing must be applied along its entire length.**

- Wipe off excess grease on the outside of the bearing with a paper towel.

- Use this procedure for both LM10LUU bearings.

# [Cold pull (MK4, XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mk4-xl_445071)

A 'cold pull' is a technique that allows you to clean your printer’s nozzle and hotend from any material that may be stuck or burnt inside. You can also use it to clean your hotend during your usual maintenance routine.

If you are using Nozzle X

**do not**

use the cold-pull method, but only use cleaning filament.

The cold pull should be done if your nozzle is only partially clogged, and some filament is still being extruded. If the nozzle is completely clogged, please check the [clogged hotend article for MK4](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-hotend-mk4_411823), or the [clogged hotend article for XL](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-hotend-xl_401294).

Our testing has found that PLA works best for a cold pull, as other filaments do not retain the tip as PLA does and they will either tear or melt too much. However, there are filaments specifically made for cleaning hotends.

### Preliminary steps for XL

On the Original Prusa XL, proceed with these two steps before the cold pull procedure.

1. Insert a piece of filament into the side PTFE tube, just enough to trigger the side filament sensor.
2. Unscrew the Bowden PTFE tube above the extruder.



### Cold pull procedure

1. Load a piece of PLA filament in the extruder, inserting it from above the extruder. The printer will prompt a material selection: select PLA and complete the loading procedure.
2. Open the Idler Swivel.


_Original Prusa MK4_ _Original Prusa XL_

3. Go to _LCD Menu - > Control -> Temperature -> Nozzle Temperature_ and set the temperature to 270 °C.
4. Once it has reached 270 °C push the PLA filament in until it starts pouring out of the nozzle.
5. Stop heating by pressing Cooldown in the _LCD Menu - > Control -> Temperature -> Cooldown_, or by pressing the reset button.
6. Continue manually pushing the filament down until the temperature is too low for it to melt and come out (around 170 °C for PLA). The nozzle has to be filled for the cold pull to be successful.
7. Pick away any extruded material from the nozzle so there is nothing obstructing the pull later on.
8. Wait for the temperature to reach 100 °C. As soon as it reaches 100 °C, grab the filament with pliers and pull it slowly but steadily out of the extruder. Make sure to pull straight upwards, not sideways, or the filament can break inside. Hold the extruder with your other hand.
9. Don't stop until the filament is completely pulled out from the extruder.



### Results

On the tip of the filament that has been pulled out, you may see remnants of the previous material(s) you have been using or some burnt dirt that has settled in the nozzle (left picture). You might want to repeat this procedure several times until the filament comes out clean.

The right picture shows what a clean cold-pulled filament should look like. It is important to have the imprint of the nozzle on it, this way you are sure the nozzle was filled and nothing was left inside. Also, the color is not mixed with the one you have been using previously or has dark marks on it.

After the procedure, close the Idler and the Idler Swivel.

# [Input Shaper (MK4, XL, MINI/+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/input-shaper-mk4-xl-mini-_451816)

Starting from firmware 5.0.0 for the MK4, and firmware 5.1.0 for the MINI/+ and the XL, the printers will have the **Input Shaper** feature.

Input Shaper is a feature designed to reduce ghosting by canceling resonance vibrations. It works by analyzing the printer’s movements and applying a filter to the input signals. Thanks to faster travel speed and acceleration, it minimizes stringing and enables faster printing. The pressure in the nozzle from the faster printing is compensated by another firmware feature, the Pressure Advance.

### How does it affect my printer?

We strongly suggest performing [basic maintenance](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/regular-printer-maintenance-mk4_419000) on the MK4 before you start to use the Input shaper to achieve the best possible print performance. Make sure the [belts on the X and Y axes are not loose](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mk3-mk3s-mk3s-mk3-5-mk4_112380), the nozzle is in good shape, and there’s no debris on the smooth rods.

#### Crash detection

Due to high accelerations and print speed, the crash detection feature is not compatible.

### PrusaSlicer Profiles

To use the Input shaper, it is not only necessary to have the proper firmware, but also the Input shaper profile on PrusaSlicer. Once the profile is selected, you will see that the layer height profiles have been renamed to reflect their use better.

On the non-input shaper profile, the two qualities for each Layer height are

* **Quality:** settings primarily focused on the overall look and precision, with a compromise to the speed, thus taking longer to print.
* **Speed:** settings primarily focused on time savings, with some compromise to the look and precision.



With the Input shaper profile, the two qualities for each Layer height are:

* **Structural:** settings focused on quality, precision, and structural integrity while retaining reasonably high printing speed (still much faster than printing without Input shaping).
* **Speed:** Short printing times are the top priority with this profile. It pushes the printer closer to its limits while keeping good quality and accuracy.



The **Ultradetail** profile in the Input Shaper settings is the **Fast detail** , which is the smallest layer height for the 0.4 mm nozzle Input shaper profile.

Note that the input shaper is not only determined by the printing (or travel) speed and acceleration, the firmware, or the hardware limits of the printer. The printing material is also a limiting factor. Every filament requires to be properly melted in the nozzle, extruded at the correct temperature, and cooled once deposited on the layer below. If the temperature and cooling are too high or too low, the print will inevitably have problems - mostly poor interlayer connection and compromised structural integrity in general. The **"Speed"** profiles for our printers are optimized, so a printed object can be finished fast, but with only a small impact on its structural integrity.

### How to set it in the G-code

The G-code to apply is M593. Below are the parameters that can be set.

Damping Ratio
D - Set the input shaper damping ratio. If axes (X, Y, etc.) are not specified, set it for all axes. The default value is 0.1.

Frequency
F - Set the input shaper frequency. If axes (X, Y, etc.) are not specified, set it for all axes. The default value is 0Hz, which means that the input shaper is disabled.

Type
T[map] - Set the input shaper type, 0:ZV, 1:ZVD, 2:MZV, 3:EI, 4:2HUMP_EI, and 5:3HUMP_EI. The default value is 0:ZV.

Vibration Reduction
R - Set the input shaper vibration reduction. This parameter is used just for 3:EI, 4:2HUMP_EI, and 5:3HUMP_EI. The default value is 20.

Limit to X-axis or Y-axis
X<1> \- Set the input shaper parameters only for the X-axis.
Y<1> \- Set the input shaper parameters only for the Y-axis.

# [How to update firmware (MK4/XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk4-xl_453086)

On the Original Prusa MK4 and XL, the firmware is flashed by using a USB flash drive.

1. Download the latest firmware for your printer and extract it (zip file) on your computer
2. Make sure the USB flash drive doesn't contain any previous firmware (.bbf file)
3. Copy the new .bbf file to the root directory of a USB flash drive (Not within a folder).
4. Insert the USB flash drive and push the reset button **.** The bootloader will automatically compare the installed version with the one on the drive and, if newer, will automatically offer you to flash it.
5. Confirm the update by selecting the "FLASH" button and pressing the knob.



### Alternative method - older firmware release (firmware downgrade)

It is not possible to flash to the same, or an older version of the firmware release, using the method above. To flash an older firmware the procedure is as follows:

1. Push the reset button, immediately followed by clicking the selector knob.
2. On the new screen, confirm the update by selecting the "FLASH" button and pressing the knob.



If it repeatedly only boots the printer and gives you the home screen try to

# [Filament sensor (MK4, MK3.9)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-sensor-mk4-mk3-9_465702)

The **filament sensor** equipped on the **Original Prusa MK4** and **Original Prusa MK3.9** detects the presence of a filament and filament run-out. The sensor is a Hall sensor, triggered by a mechanism composed of a spring, a magnet, and a ball.

During usage, it is possible that filament residue might build up around the sensor or its mechanism, possibly causing false readings and thus malfunctioning.

### How to clean the filament sensor

#### 1) Compressed air

At the top of the extruder is a small hole, insert the tip of a compressed air can in the hole. With your free hand, prepare a bit of filament with a non-stringy tip. Repeatedly insert and remove the filament from the extruder, while blowing the compressed air. This will dislodge the build-up debris.

#### 2) Filament tip insertion

In case you don't have compressed air at hand, a similar procedure to the one above can be attempted.

Prepare a bit of filament with a non-stringy tip. Repeatedly insert and remove the filament from the extruder. It will be necessary to insert and remove the bit of filament several times to achieve good cleaning, and the technique might not always be effective.

#### 3) Removing the sensor

If the previous techniques do not work, the filament sensor can be removed to be manually cleaned. This procedure requires partial disassembly of the E-axis.

1. Unload the filament, then wait for the printer to fully cool down. After that, turn the printer off.
2. Remove the PG-case, together with the PG-ring, gearbox, and main plate. Remove all of these parts in one piece.


3. Remove the **Prusa-ball-holder** using pliers.


4. Carefully remove the ball-magnet-spring combo from the Prusa-ball-holder and clean any debris out of it. Clean also the slot on the heatsink.


5. Reassemble the Prusa-ball-holder in the following order: steel ball, magnet, and spring.


6. Reassemble the block with PG-case, PG-ring, gearbox, and main plate.

# [Multi-tool manual calibration (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multi-tool-manual-calibration-xl_470560)

The **multi-tool manual calibration** for the multi-tool versions of the Original Prusa XL can be done to ensure that the Tool Offset Calibration worked correctly and to fine-tune the offset for each tool. This calibration is also recommended after a nozzle crash, or if a custom nozzle is in use. We prepared a specific test GCode for the dual-head and five-head versions, designed to cover offset errors up to +/-1mm.

The print has two zones labeled X and Y, each with one comb for each tool, excluding Tool 1. For each comb, find the two marks in each zone that are most aligned with the comb printed with Tool 1 and read their values.

The largest mark represents 0 and the medium marks represent 0.5mm.

In the following visualization of the 2-Tool calibration GCode, **the orange parts are printed with Tool 1** , and the **magenta parts with Tool 2**.

The 5-Tool calibration GCode has the same properties, but it has four combs per axis. Each tool offset is compared to Tool 1.

### Procedure

1. Print the model. Use one of the GCodes, to print in PLA, depending on the number of tools.
2. After the print is finished, remove the steel sheet with the print still on, and observe the marks. If you are in doubt between two marks, choose their average value (for example, if 0mm and +0,1mm are both almost aligned, then choose an offset of +0,05mm).
3. Adjust the offsets by adding the measured offset to the offset already shown for the selected tool in _LCD Menu - > Settings -> Tool -> Tool # _(the number of the tool is shown in place of #). For example, adding 0.05mm to Offset X in the screenshot would result in a final value of 0.071347mm.

For Tool 1 the offset value is not shown, as it is always set to zero.

4. After correcting the offsets, remove any small plastic residues from the linear rails and belts to avoid affecting the homing position. Remove the print from the steel sheet, and print the test piece once again to check the alignment.

# [MMU3 firmware compatibility](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/mmu3-firmware-compatibility_470808)

The Original Prusa MMU3 is a direct successor to the Original Prusa MMU2S. The MMU3 unit brings significant hardware changes and includes brand-new firmware (version 3.0.0 or newer). This firmware is reverse-compatible, enabling its use with the MMU2S as well. Please review the provided information attentively, and if you have any doubts or questions, do not hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance.

### MMU firmware

The MMU3 utilizes new firmware for both the printer and the MMU unit. It's crucial to understand that **beginning with MMU firmware 3.0.0, each release aligns with a specific printer firmware version.** To prevent compatibility problems, when updating your printer, make sure to use the most recent firmware combination for both the printer and the MMU unit.

**MMU firmware** **Compatible printer firmware
Original Prusa i3 MK3S+
** **Compatible printer firmware
Original Prusa MK4/MK3.9/3.5**
1.0.6 or older (MMU2S only)3.12.2 or oldernot compatible
3.0.03.13.0 to 3.13.1(TBA)
3.0.1 3.13.2(TBA)

### **Supported MMU - Printer combinations**

The list below describes a combination of a printer with either MMU3 or MMU2S unit running the firmware 3.0.0 or newer:

* **Original Prusa MK3.9 / MK4**
* **MMU3 unit** \- Fully compatible*. All the required parts are included in the MMU3 MK4/MK3.9 package.
* **MMU2S unit** \- Can be [upgraded to MMU3](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mmu2s-to-mmu3-upgrade-for-mk4-2/) to be used with the printer.
* **Original Prusa MK3S+**
* **MMU3 unit** \- Fully compatible*. All the required parts are included in the MMU3 MK3S+ package.
* **MMU2S unit** with firmware 3.0.0 and up - Compatible.
* **Original Prusa MK3.5**
* MMU3 unit - Fully compatible*. All the required parts are included in the MMU3 MK3.5 package.
* MMU2S unit - Can be upgraded to MMU3 to be used with the printer.


* **Original Prusa MK3S**
* **MMU3 unit** \- This combination is possible, but the MMU3 package contains improved extruder parts designed for the MK3S+ extruder only, as there is a different _adapter-printer-mmu_ part for [MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/adapter-printer-mmu2s/) and [MK3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/adapter-printer-or-mmu2s-mk3s/). MK3S&MMU2S had a similarly-looking but different filament sensor assembly than MK3S+&MMU2S. When upgrading to the MMU3 chimney, a new extruder-idler-mmu part has to be printed.
Additionally, note that the PTFE hotend tube supplied in the MMU3 package is only compatible with MK3S+ extruder.
We recommend upgrading the printer to MK3S+ before attaching the MMU3 to it.
* **MMU2S unit** with firmware 3.0.0 and up - Compatible.
* **Original Prusa MK3**
* **MMU3 unit -** Outdated extruder hardware (filament sensor and printed parts). The firmware is not optimized for this configuration. We recommend [upgrading the printer to MK3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3-s-to-mk3s-upgrade-kit/) before attaching the MMU3 to it.
* **MMU2S unit** with firmware 3.0.0 and up - The firmware is not optimized for this configuration. We recommend [upgrading the printer to MK3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3-s-to-mk3s-upgrade-kit/) before attaching the MMU2S to it.


* **Original Prusa MK2.5S**
* **MMU3 unit** \- This setup is under investigation by our developers. The main concern is different system voltage compared to the MK3S+ (12 vs. 24 V). The new MMU3 wiring harness is not compatible. The firmware is not optimized for this configuration.
* **MMU2S unit** with firmware 3.0.0 and up - The main concern is different system voltage compared to the MK3S+ (12 vs. 24 V). The firmware is not optimized for this configuration.
* **Original Prusa MK2.5**
* **MMU3 unit** \- The new MMU3 wiring harness is not compatible. Also, the firmware is not optimized for this configuration.
* **MMU2S unit** with firmware 3.0.0 and up - The firmware is not optimized for this configuration.



*This hardware setup was thoroughly tested and verified by our testing teams.

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_473977)

- 3D printed parts are very precise, however, there still might be a tolerance in the printed part and same goes for the size of the nut.

- Therefore it might happen, that the nut won't fit easily in or might be falling out. Let's see, how to fix it:

-  **Nut won't fit in** : use a screw with a thread along its entire length (typically: M3x10, M3x18) and screw it from the opposite side of the opening. While tightening the screw, the nut will be pulled in. Remove the screw afterwards.

-  **Alternative option** : you can use X-holder tool included in the package. Insert any screw (typically: M3x10 or M3x18) and screw the nut fully on the tip of the thread. Push the nut into the printed part and remove the screw with X-holder.

-  **Nut keeps falling out** : Use a piece of tape to fix the nut temporarily in place, as soon as you insert the screw in, you can remove the tape. Using glue isn't recommended as it can partly reach into the thread and you won't be able to tighten the screw properly.

- Every time we recommend using the "screw pulling technique", you will be reminded with Joe's avatar ;)

Parts in the pictures are used as an example.

# [Organic Supports](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/organic-supports_480131)

Organic supports are a type of support structure available in PrusaSlicer.

PrusaSlicer previously always used a 2D grid-based approach to generate supports. Although this method delivered decent results in many situations, it had its limitations. The supports often consumed quite a lot of filament, took a long time to print, ended up in spaces where they were difficult to remove from, and left visible marks on the model when removed. Especially when the settings were not tuned correctly. We improved some of these downsides by introducing the “Snug” supports in PrusaSlicer 2.4.

Grid supports (left) vs Organic supports (right)

The Organic supports are our significantly improved implementation of tree supports. We choose a new name for our supports because of their distinctly smooth shape and several differences in their behavior.

In contrast to the previously common implementation of tree supports, the branching of Organic supports is smarter and we made them straighter (shorter), smoother, and more stable. The cross-section perpendicular to the branch axis is guaranteed to be circular, and the algorithm automatically uses double perimeter walls for the trees where needed (this is configurable).

**Organic supports are easily removable, do not scar the surface, and are fast and cheap to print.**

Our implementation is an evolution of the tree supports by Thomas Rahm, which are significantly improved tree supports originally from Cura. We would like to thank Ultimaker Cura and Thomas Rahm for the effort they have invested into the problem.

After you turn on Support generation, you can switch to Organic supports in **Print settings - Support material - Style**.

Apart from the settings common for all support types, there are additional settings specific to the Organic supports.

### Organic supports settings

The maximum angle of the branches, when the branches have to avoid the model. Use a lower angle to make them more vertical and more stable. Use a higher angle to be able to have more reach.

The preferred angle of the branches, when they do not have to avoid the model. Use a lower angle to make them more vertical and more stable. Use a higher angle for branches to merge faster.

The diameter of the thinnest branches of organic supports. Thicker branches are sturdier. Branches towards the base will be wider than this.

The angle of the branches' diameter as they gradually become thicker towards the bottom. An angle of 0 will cause the branches to have a uniform thickness over their length. A bit of an angle can increase the stability of the organic supports.

**Branch Diameter with Double Walls**

Branches with an area larger than the area of a circle of this diameter will be printed with double walls for stability.

Set this value to zero for no double walls.

Branch tip diameter for organic supports.

How far apart the branches need to be when they touch the model. Making this distance small will cause the tree support to touch the model at more points, causing better overhangs printing but making the supports harder to remove.

Adjusts the density of the support structure used to generate the tips of the branches. A higher value results in better overhangs but the supports are harder to remove. We recommend keeping the top support interfaces enabled instead of using a high branch density value if dense interfaces are needed.

Organic supports can be manually enforced or blocked using the Paint-on supports tool.

# [Speed settings](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/speed-settings_480325)

### Speed settings for different print moves

You can set different speed limits for each of the print move types. Keep in mind, that during printing, the print speeds are affected by the printer's acceleration and jerk settings. E.g. when printing small models, it's possible the printer will never actually reach the target speeds.

You can switch the preview mode to _Speed_ in order to inspect the actual print speeds after all the accelerations are applied.

### Dynamic overhang speed

As the name suggests, this feature lets you slow down the print speed when printing overhangs, which enables better cooling when it’s needed. The algorithm calculates extrusion overlap with the previous layer and applies speed calculated from the overhang slowdown function.

Users can control the shape of the overhang slowdown function via four input points – each point has an extrusion overlap value expressed as a percentage of the full width, and desired speed on such overlap. The speeds in between the control points are calculated via linear interpolation.

# [Load to extruder failed #04108 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/load-to-extruder-failed-04108-mmu_480404)

### What happened?

While loading to the extruder, as soon as the filament sensor detects a filament the printer performs an automatic loading check. If the check fails, this error is shown. Each failed load might be accompanied by the printer beeping.

The printer’s automatic loading check loads approximately 40mm of filament and then unloads 30mm of it. If the filament sensor stops detecting a filament at any time during the process, the error is shown. This process is very sensitive, so making a precise Filament sensor calibration is needed in order to prevent print defects.


While your MK3S+ is performing the loading check, **solid blocks** should be generated on the bottom of the LCD representing the IR filament sensor **detecting a filament** during the process.

If there is a **line instead** of any blocks (drop in the sensor’s reading), this means that the sensor **stopped detecting** filament at that moment, resulting in a failed loading check. The printer then retries the load. If the cut function is enabled, the MMU tries to cut a filament tip. If the drop while loading persists even during the retries, the printer unloads the filament and shows the error.

### How to fix it?

* Redo the [IR filament sensor calibration (MMU2S)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ir-filament-sensor-calibration-mmu2s_2245).
* While the printer is Idle, you can use the Loading test in _LCD menu - > Settings -> Loading Test_ to verify the filament is able to load properly.
* Undo the PTFE tube from the FESTO fitting and pull the filament out by hand to inspect it. The last 40cm (15") of each should have no dents in it, or the gears won't be able to grab the filament. Cut off part of the filament with defects such as indentation or a deformed tip. Make sure the filament end is straight and has a sharp tip at the end. Reattach the PTFE tube and hit Retry.


* Inspect the extruder to rule out a hardware fault such as [misaligned Bondtech gears](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/checking-re-aligning-the-bondtech-gear-mk3s-mk2-5s_133176) or Extruder Idler shaft not inserted correctly.
* In case the issue continues to happen over multiple unloads, check the [extruder for clogging](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3-5-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008).
* Inspect the filament spool and the buffer for excessive friction or filament jam. Make sure the filament is able to move freely.
* Use only high-quality filaments. Certain poor-quality filaments or very specific types of material might not work correctly with the MMU.

# [Unload manually #04506 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/unload-manually-04506-mmu_480414)

### What happened?

Implausible SuperFINDA reading. This error happens when a filament is detected by the SuperFINDA sensor although the MMU doesn’t have a record of any filament being loaded. It is unsure of which position the filament is loaded in so it can’t perform the unload automatically.

This usually happens, if the user was loading a filament manually not using the menu/buttons, or if the printer was restarted while performing a certain load/unload operation without finishing it first.

### How to fix it?

* Unload a filament manually or clear the sensors from any filament to continue.
* Verify the [superFINDA calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/finda-setup-and-troubleshooting_2250).
* Use only the menu on the printer to load or unload a filament during regular use.

# [Filament ejected #04507 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-ejected-04507-mmu_480424)

### What happened?

The filament has been ejected to the front of the MMU unit so that you can remove it.

This feature is handy in case you are using the Spooljoin function. A depleted filament might be too short in order to be removed easily from the back of the unit. By ejecting it to the front of the unit, you can easily grab it and discard it.

### How to proceed?

Remove and discard the ejected piece of filament and hit the button on the LCD screen.

If you accidentally triggered the eject function, push the ejected filament back into the MMU unit and make sure it isn’t protruding out of the short front PTFE tubes - so that the selector doesn’t jam later on.

It checks if the main control board behaves correctly and if all the signals from the microcontroller get to the TMC motor drivers on the control board properly. If the MMU unit suspects the communication with the pulley motor TMC driver might not behave correctly, this error is shown.

### How to fix it?

\- Make sure your MMU3 unit is correctly assembled with the PD-board addon attached.

\- Verify all the cables are in good condition and the connections are stable. **Do not move, connect or disconnect the cables while the printer is on!**

If the issue persists, contact support.

# [Invalid tool #04502 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/invalid-tool-04502-mmu_483832)

### What happened?

MMU3 operates with 5 “tools” (materials - filament positions), labeled 1 - 5 on the unit. The desired filament position is selected by G-codes T[number]:

**T0: Filament 1**
**T1: Filament 2**
**T2: Filament 3**
**T3: Filament 4**
**T4: Filament 5**

Tx: Lets the user select a filament position from the LCD menu
T?: Legacy G-code for Tx

If you, for example, issue a T5 command to the printer, this error will be shown, because the tool range available for MMU3 is T0-T4 only.

### How to fix it?

If you use a 3rd party software to control the MMU printer, make sure the number of extruders is set to 5; counting from T0 to T4.

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_484364)

- Building the XL printer is definitely a challenge. So it is important to reward yourself after the difficult parts of the manual. **That's why we included a bucket of Haribo bears in the package!**

After completing each chapter or challenging section of the chapter, you will be prompted to replenish energy for the following steps.

**Don't eat all the bears before you start or at once!**

Not following instructions will have serious consequences, we are currently assembling

**Prusa Haribo tactical squad**

for this matter.

**Do not eat any of the Harribo Bears now!**

It is

**VERY IMPORTANT**

to distribute the amount correctly during assembly. We tried all sorts of combinations of quantities. Finally, we reached a successful result.

- All right, eat one gummy bear. It will give you energy to start the assembly. ;) **But just one!**

- Are you ready to get started on the assembly? Let's move on to chapter **2\. Base & Side frame assembly.**

# [Filament already loaded #04501 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-already-loaded-04501-mmu_484815)

### What happened?

Other than the sensors (SuperFINDA and Extruder filament sensor), the MMU also has a record of filament being loaded or unloaded. This way, the unit can stay reliable even in case the sensors are not properly calibrated or are damaged.

If there is a record of filament being loaded into the extruder, there is a green light for the corresponding filament position on the MMU unit. If you attempt to load another filament while there is a record that the filament is already loaded, this error will be shown.

### How to fix it?

First, hit Unload filament in the LCD menu, the filament will unload and the Filament Loaded record will be cleared.

In case you have unloaded the filament by hand, the printer might not know about it. Next time, use the Unload Filament function from the menu.

If the printer just started up or was restarted, the “FilamentLoaded” record is cleared automatically if both SuperFINDA and the filament sensor in the extruder do not detect a filament.

# [2. Base & Side frame assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-side-frame-assembly_485372)

- Turn the right side (no sticker) of the base towards you. Use the extrusion plastic cap as a guide.

- Make sure one profile insert is slid all the way to the back.

**Be careful while connecting extrusions together, avoid scratching them**

. The orientation of the silver pin doesn't matter.

- Before you connect the extrusions together, see the protrusion in the "standalone" extrusion. This part must be aligned with the "groove" in the base extrusion. See the bubble in the third picture.

- Take one rear extrusion prepared earlier and slide its pin into the profile insert. Mind the correct orientation of the extrusion (protrusion vs groove).

- There might be a slight gap between parts, we will address this in the next step.

# [Combining materials (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/combining-materials-xl_498103)

On the Original Prusa XL multi-tool, it is possible to combine different materials within the same print. The following aspects and considerations have to be kept in mind for a successful print.

### Preliminary info

When an extruder is parked, the nozzle installed on that extruder cools down.

High temperatures without printing can cause a loaded filament to degrade and can cause the pressure in the melt zone to raise. While an extruder is idle, cooling down the nozzle helps counteract this process, especially for an extended docked time.

At any time the nozzle temperature is high, any moisture absorbed by the filament will have to escape somewhere. This generally leads to increased pressure in the nozzle, typically leading to **oozing**. The oozed filament is deposed on the **prime tower** , possibly creating a blob.

These effects will be worse the more moisture is present in the filament.

To limit these negative effects, it is crucial to [keep the filament dry](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/drying-filament_332086). Some filament settings might need to be fine-tuned, and it is fundamental that the Nozzle Seal is set to the correct position for all tools. The scale of these effects also depends on the specific filament material.

If you decide to use flexible filament check out our video guide on [how to load flexible filament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCOMrs83SYs) into the Original Prusa XL.

### Prime tower settings

#### Minimal purge on wipe tower

The **minimal purge on wipe tower** sets the minimum amount of material to prime into the prime tower. Its value can be adjusted in _Filament settings - > Advanced_. The oozing that happens when the tool is picked causes material loss. Increasing this volume will decrease the chance this causing under-extrusion at the start of the print.

For PLA prints, the default and recommended value for this setting is 15mm³. For any other material, the default value is 35mm³. We also recommend setting the value at 35mm³ for each extruder for a print with a combination of PLA and another material.

TPU is very prone to stringing due to it absorbing a high amount of moisture. While it has been tested with the **minimal purge on wipe tower** at 35mm³, in case of issues with stringing and oozing, we recommend further increasing this value, even up to 70mm³. TPE is a good alternative flexible material, as it generally absorbs less moisture than TPU, but note that TPE has a poor bed adhesion.

When printing rigid filaments on top of TPE or TPU, the lower TPE or TPU layers can be moved around by the rigid filament printing on top of them. This can also be counteracted by increasing the **minimal purge on wipe tower**.

#### Wipe tower extruder

On the prime tower, the filaments might not stick to each other. This can cause the tower to break and cause crashes on the print. To prevent that, go to _Print settings - > Multiple Extruders -> Wipe tower extruder_, and select an extruder for the prime tower. This will cause one of the extruders with a specific filament to act on all tower layers, even if it is not used in the print, making the tower more stable. Leaving the value at 0 will use the tool that is available, which is the last one used in that layer. This saves time but, when printing with more than one type of material, makes the prime tower less reliable.

#### Stabilization cone apex angle

To increase the stability and bottom area of the prime tower, it is possible to add a conical shape that would combine with the prime tower shape. The apex angle of this cone can be set between 0 and 90 degrees, in _Print settings - > Multiple Extruders_, with a larger angle meaning that the cone base is larger and the prime tower more stable.

### PLA + PETG

PETG has been tested with PLA supports with success, as well as PLA with PETG supports. For that, the PrusaSlicer print setting needs to be **soluble full**.

By default, a **solid sheath** (one perimeter wall) will be generated around the supports set as soluble, making it very difficult to remove them. We recommend unselecting this setting, in _Print Settings - > Support Material_.

By default, the support material is set to be on Extruder 2. If needed, you can change this by selecting the **support material/raft/skirt extruder** and the **support material/raft/interface extruder** in _Print Settings - > Multiple Extruders_.

### Other PrusaSlicer settings

#### Heatbed temperature

On the first layer, the heatbed temperature is based on the first material loaded in the print; from the second layer onwards, it is based on the first filament that is loaded on the second layer. Depending on the filament combination, this can generate issues, such as a lack of adhesion.

PrusaSlicer shows a warning in case the heatbed temperatures significantly differ.

To go around this, go to _Filament settings - > Filament_, and, for each extruder, choose a heatbed temperature, depending on all the materials that are used throughout the print. Once chosen, save the modified filament profile, name it, and ensure the modified profile is selected for the print.

#### Ooze prevention

In PrusaSlicer, in _Print Settings - > Multiple extruders_, leave **ooze prevention** enabled. This will allow the idle temperature in _Filament settings - > Filament -> Idle temperature_ to stay at the best idle temperature for the specific filament. The temperature in the idle temperature setting has priority over the temperature variation in the ooze prevention setting.

If **ooze prevention** is disabled, all the extruders will stay at their print temperature during the whole print. This leads to significant oozing, material degradation in the melt zone, and possibly nozzle clogging.

#### Considerations on support styles

When using **snug** supports, check in the sliced object for parts of the support material that might be very tall and thin, as these might fall or break in the middle of the print. If you notice them in your sliced object, we recommend changing the support **pattern** , and/or changing the support style to **grid**.

When using **organic** supports, don't use **interface layers** , or they will create unprintable artifacts.

On the Original Prusa XL multi-tool, it is possible to combine different materials within the same print. The following aspects and considerations have to be kept in mind for a successful print.

### Preliminary info

When an extruder is parked, the nozzle installed on that extruder cools down.

Having high temperatures on the hotend while it is not printing can cause a loaded filament to degrade and the pressure in the melt zone to rise. While an extruder is idle, cooling down the nozzle helps counteract this process, especially for an extended docked time.

At any time the nozzle temperature is high, any moisture absorbed by the filament will have to escape somewhere. This generally leads to increased pressure in the nozzle, typically leading to **oozing**. The oozed filament is deposed on the **prime tower** , possibly creating a blob.

When using **snug** supports, check in the sliced object for parts of the support material that might be very tall and thin, as these might fall or break in the middle of the print. If you notice them in your sliced object, we recommend changing the support **pattern** , and/or changing the support style to **grid**.

When using **organic** supports, don't use **interface layers** , or they will create unprintable artifacts.

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_498112)

- Building the XL printer is definitely a challenge. So it is important to reward yourself after the difficult parts of the manual. **That's why we included a bucket of Haribo bears in the package!**

After completing each chapter or challenging section of the chapter, you will be prompted to replenish energy for the following steps.

**Don't eat all the bears before you start or at once!**

Not following instructions will have serious consequences, we are currently assembling

**Prusa Haribo tactical squad**

for this matter.

**Do not eat any of the Harribo Bears now!**

It is

**VERY IMPORTANT**

to distribute the amount correctly during assembly. We tried all sorts of combinations of quantities. Finally, we reached a successful result.

- All right, eat one gummy bear. It will give you energy to start the assembly. ;) **But just one!**

- Are you ready to get started on the assembly? Let's move on to chapter **2\. Base & Side frame assembly.**

---

# [3. Printer set up](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-printer-set-up_498606)

- Carefully turn the printer so that the side with the Filament sensor (with 3 PTFE tubes) is facing you.

- Insert the first M4nEs nut into the front support extrusion (with the orange plastic cover). Insert the side with the spring (metal plate) first, then push the nut inside.

- Insert the second and the third M4nEs nut into the extrusions as described in the picture.

- The M4nEs nuts are free to move, you can adjust the position as you want. But remember, the nuts must be slightly pushed in to smoothly move. Anyway, we recommend approximately the same position as you can see in the picture.

# [Filament change #04508 (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/filament-change-04508-mmu_500088)

### What happened?

This error happens when the filament change function is triggered. This can happen by:

* Filament change command in the printer’s menu.
* Issuing the M600 G-code command.
* The printer detects a depleted filament (when the Spooljoin function is off).



Remove the old filament from the MMU unit and replace it with a new one. Click the option Load and select the desired filament position. You can select the one you previously used or a new position.

In case you need to eject the depleted filament out of the front of the MMU unit, select Eject. The Selector will move until the filament slot is free, and the filament will be ejected to the front so that you can pull it out easily.

# [Precise Refinement Failed #17102 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/precise-refinement-failed-17102-xl_500120)

### What happened?

If an Original Prusa XL detects a crash, after it the printer will attempt to find a reference point, through a procedure called **Precise homing**. If the right and left sides are not aligned, the Precise Homing will fail, and this error will be shown.

Error name: Precise Refinement Failed

### How to fix it?

Check the belt tension, and [adjust it if needed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-xl_401793). Ensure that the printer's [right and left sides are perfectly aligned](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/adjusting-belt-tension-xl_401793#alignment).

After correctly adjusting the belts, the two plastic parts on the sides of the rail should reach the front of the axis together.

---

# [2. Base & Side frame assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-base-side-frame-assembly_500146)

- Turn the right side (no sticker) of the base towards you. Use the extrusion plastic cap as a guide.

- Make sure one profile insert is slid all the way to the back.

**Be careful while connecting extrusions together, avoid scratching them**

. The orientation of the silver pin doesn't matter.

- Before you connect the extrusions together, see the protrusion in the "standalone" extrusion. This part must be aligned with the "groove" in the base extrusion. See the bubble in the third picture.

- Take one rear extrusion prepared earlier and slide its pin into the profile insert. Mind the correct orientation of the extrusion (protrusion vs groove).

- There might be a slight gap between parts, we will address this in the next step.

---

# [3. CoreXY & Back assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-corexy-back-assembly_501764)

-  **Are you left or right-handed?** The printer should be already laying on its left side from the previous chapter. If you are a left-hander rotate it carefully on the opposite right side (see the picture). We are going to attach the upper CoreXY part and tighten the screws to interconnect both parts together. The instructions are the same, **choose the side which suits you better for tightening the screws** _._

It is recommended to place a cardboard pad under the side of the base to protect the work bench and the frame from scratch.

- There's a hole in the extrusion that the pin has to fit into.

- Move the rear profile insert inside each extrusion of the CoreXY to the rear side of the assembly.

- Slide the remaining inserts approximately to the middle. Precise position will be addressed later.

- Rotate the CoreXY on its longer side and put it near the top of the four base extrusions.

- The rear profile inserts must be facing against the rear extrusions. Do not push the CoreXY all the way in until you are prompted.

---

# [4. Heatbed & Side panels assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-heatbed-side-panels-assembly_503880)

- Take the left Z-axis part and slide it up to the heatbed frame.

- Fix it to the heatbed frame with two M3x12rT screws using the T10 screwdriver. Don't tighten it all the way yet!

- Now, fix the **right** Z-axis part to the heatbed frame using the same technique.

- Now, tighten all four screws in a cross pattern:

- First, tighten the front right and rear left screws.

- Then, tighten the front left and rear right screws.

---

# [5. Tool-changer assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-tool-changer-assembly_504693)

Reminder: To handle the printer,

**always grab the handles on both sides of the printer**

. Do not lift the printer by the aluminum extrusions or the metal sheet profiles on top.

In the following steps, we will work with tools and install the Nextruder above the heatbed, it is recommended to protect it against any possible damage. An empty Prusament box can serve this purpouse.

- For better access when mounting the Nextruder, manually move the heatbed down.

- Place the empty cardboard box approximately to the front center part of the heatbed.

- Move the X-axis assembly all the way to the front side of the printer.

- Move the X-carriage approximately to the center of the X-axis.

# [Dock position out of bounds #17103 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/dock-position-out-of-bounds-17103-xl_505117)

### What happened?

The XL tool heads are connected to a metal profile on the back extrusion of the XL. During the selftest of the multi-tool head, the wizard will guide you through the **[Dock position calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-first-run_468832#469222)** to properly align the tool heads. In case the tools are not aligned correctly, this error will be shown.

Error name: Dock position out of bounds

### How to fix it?

First, make sure that the metal profile that holds the extruders is all the way to the left side of the printer facing it from the back.

After that, restart the **Dock Position calibration** by going to _LCD menu - > Control -> Calibrations & Tests -> 4 Dock Position Calibration_. Align the tool heads again.

---

# [Tool offset out of bounds #17104 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/tool-offset-out-of-bounds-17104-xl_506330)

### What happened?

On the multi-tool versions of the Original Prusa XL, the offset of the tools compared to the first is calibrated through the [Tool Offset Calibration](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-first-run_468832#469249). If the offset of one of the tools deviates too far from the expected range, the printer will show the following message: " **Tool %d offset %c: %.3f is out of bounds [%.3f, %.3f]** ".

In place of %d, the number of the tool is shown, in place of %c the axis, and in place of %3f the values.

Error name: Tool offset out of bounds

### How to fix it?

#### A visual inspection

Check if the nozzle is pushed into the heatsink. Ensure that the nozzle is correctly positioned.

Make sure that the filament is unloaded before the calibration process, and that there is no filament residue under the nozzle.

#### Swap the hotend

If the points above did not solve the issue, swap the hotend of the failing tool with one of the hotends from a tool that passes the calibration.

If the error moves with the hotend, please contact our [customer support](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/customer-support_2287) with this information.

# [Power Panic #17321 (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/power-panic-17321-xl_506440)

### What happened?

The Original Prusa XL is equipped with a Power Panic cable, which can recover the printer from a complete loss of power without needing batteries or an UPS. If the power panic cable is damaged or disconnected, the printer will not work, and show the text ' **Power panic detected on startup. Check power panic cable'**.

### How to fix it?

Make sure that you have a USB drive with the [latest firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads) connected to the printer. Go to the printer menu in _Settings - > System -> Factory reset -> Hard Reset. _The USB drive with the latest firmware has to be connected to the printer for the procedure.

After that, it will be necessary to go through the initial printer calibration again.

# [How to replace the Prusa Nozzle (XL multi-tool)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-the-prusa-nozzle-xl-multi-tool_506481)

**WARNING: The hotend and heatbed are very HOT. Do not touch these parts!!!**

For the following steps, it is necessary to have the heaterblock and the hotend clean from the remains of the filament. Otherwise, it can be difficult to release the nozzle.

If you have a Prusa hotend sock on the hotend, remove it.

- On the printer screen, go to _Preheat_ and select the latest used material. (e.g. ABS)

- Wait at least 5 minutes. The remains of the filament must be warmed up slightly so that they can be removed more easily.

- Using the brass brush, carefully clean the heaterblock and the hotend from the filament residue. Avoid contact of the brush with the hotend cables, as this could cause a short circuit.

- When the heaterblock and the hotend are perfectly clean, cool down the printer. On the screen, navigate to _Preheat - > Cooldown_.

**Wait until the hot parts are cooled down**

to ambient temperature. It takes approximately 10 minutes.

---

# [8. Spool holder Assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/8-spool-holder-assembly_509381)

-

There are protrusions on each side of the Guide part.

- Using these protrusions, the Guide parts can be joined together. To join them together, simply tilt in the Guide parts one into the other until the protrusions click in.

- The Guides can be joined together in form of a straight line.

- Or, if you flip one of the Guides around, they can be joined in an arc pattern. This is handy to form an arc of spool holders around the Buffer so that each filament path is as straight as possible.

# [Status LED explained (MMU3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/status-led-explained-mmu3_510059)

This article is describing the status of the LEDs located on the multi material unit. Together there are five LEDs on the unit that correspond to the five available filament positions.

**Attention**

: MMU3 issues should be primarily resolved using the error codes displayed on the printer's screen. This article explains basic LED statuses and also includes information for developers.

This article is valid for the MMU3 **firmware 3.0.0** and up.
Note that the earlier MMU2S firmware 1.0.6 or below behaves differently.

### During the regular MMU operation:

* GREEN solid light: The MMU has a record of the given filament being loaded in the extruder.
* GREEN flashing light: There is a loading/unloading process going on.
* RED flashing light: There is a loading/unloading error with the given filament. The unit is waiting for user interaction.
* RED and GREEN flashing lights: Internal runtime error, refer to the error shown on the printer’s LCD.



### MMU Firmware start:

After the MMU unit has been turned on or restarted, green LEDs light up from positions 5 to 1 shortly (~100ms). Each signalizes one component up and running:

* LED 5: Shift registers initialization
* LED 4: USART initialization
* LED 3: SPI communication initialization
* LED 2: motion system initialization
* LED 1: ADC initialization



If the MMU stops in this setup phase (the LEDs stay on and do not turn off), something is wrong with the electronics.

Then, a selftest routine is performed. It checks if the main control board behaves correctly and if all the signals from the microcontroller get to the TMC motor drivers on the control board properly. If the MMU unit suspects the communication with any of the three TMC motor drivers might not behave correctly, an error is shown. In that case, refer to the printer’s LCD screen.

LED lights indicate the ongoing phases of the selftest routine:

* LED 1: ok (green) / error (red) on STEP signal
* LED 2: ok (green) / error (red) on DIR signal
* LED 3: ok (green) / error (red) on ENABLE signal
* LED 4 indicates which TMC driver is being tested
* Idler = green
* Selector = red
* Pulley = green+red
* LED 5 is flashing green while the process is still ongoing.



### Other LED lights on the unit:

There are also other less important LED indicators on the unit.

* A green LED on the MMU3 PD-board addon, on the back of the unit. It signalizes the board receiving power from the printer.
* An orange indicator "breathing" on the inside of the MMU unit, on the main control board, signalizes the electronics booting up.
* A red indicator on the top of the FINDA sensor signalizes the sensor being powered up and NOT detecting a filament.

# [Factory Reset (MMU)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mmu_510075)

When upgrading the MMU2S firmware from firmware 1.0.6 (or lower) to 3.0.0 (or higher), or when you find a severe issue with the MMU, you might need to perform a factory reset.

1. On the MMU unit, hold the **left side button** and reset the unit by pushing **the button** on the right side of the MMU with an Allen key.


2. Keep the left side button pressed for a few seconds. You will see the LEDs on the MMU flashing quickly in a "snake" motion.
3. Release the MMU left-side button. As soon as you release it, the MMU EEPROM will be cleared and overwritten with factory default values and will do the selftest.



You have successfully reset the MMU. No indication will be shown on the MMU or on the printer.

# [How to replace a heatbed tile and a heatbed tile cable (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbed-tile-and-a-heatbed-tile-cable-xl_511563)

The Modular Bed board is located below the heatbed, and it is covered by bed-controller-case. Each heatbed tile is connected to the Modular Bed by a cable.

- The bed-controller-case has engraved numbers under the corresponding heatbed tile cable, with 8 cables per each side.

Locate the heatbed tile cable based on the number of the heatbed tile.

Each connector has a safety latch. It is necessary to press the latch before disconnecting. Otherwise, the connector may get damaged.

- In case of a heatbed tile cable replacement, disconnect the cable from the Modular Bed board.

- The heatbed tiles are numbered as shown in the picture.

- From the Modular Bed board side, disconnect the cable associated with the heatbed tile that will be replaced.

# [Registers MMU (MMU3)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/registers-mmu-mmu3_511780)

Starting from firmware 3.0.0, the Original Prusa Multi-material upgrade (MMU) has a set of runtime variables called registers. You can use these to read or write values into the MMU via G-codes. This article provides the list of available registers in the current firmware.

They can be different error codes and status information related to the MMU (e.g. filament errors, motor errors, temperature warnings, etc), specific parameters (feed rate, acceleration, current, etc), and different components (pulley, selector, idler, etc).

This replaces the Service menu from previous firmware versions.

The table below includes 8-bit (empty value: 0xFFh 255) and 16-bit registers (empty value: 0xFFFFh 65535). The empty values show the maximum amount the register can hold.

There are three different access types:

* Read: the register can be only read.
* Write: the register can be read and written to. The written change is not persistent (applies only until the reset of the MMU).
* Write Persistent: the register can be read and written to. The written values are stored in EEPROM even after the MMU is restarted.



### G-codes

Generally, the registers are in the MMU. One of the ways of reading/writing into the registers is through G-codes. The ones you will need here are:

* M707: Used to read values from specific addresses (e.g., the version, current error codes, filament state).
* M708: Used to write values to specific addresses, allowing for changes in various printer parameters.



Use a program like

[Putty](https://www.putty.org/)

or

[Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)

. Using Pronterface might cause damage to your MMU.

# [Power Panic #13321 (MK4)  #21321 (MK3.9) #23321 (MK3.5)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/power-panic-13321-mk4-21321-mk3-9-23321-mk3-5_512257)

### What happened?

The Original Prusa MK4/MK3.9/MK3.5 is equipped with a **Power Panic** feature. This feature can recover a print in case of a sudden power loss (read more about it [here](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/power-panic_2092)). The power panic cable goes from the printer's PSU to the xBuddy board. In case there is any damage to the cable, the printer will show **"Power panic has been detected during printer initialization. Inspect wiring of PP-cable."**

Error code: #13321 (MK4) #20321 (MK3.9) #23321 (MK3.5)

### How to fix it?

Check the connection of the cable both on the PSU and on the xBuddy board. Make sure that the cable is not damaged.

There are two versions of the power panic cable, one with only a black wire and one with black and white wires. Both are compatible with the MK4/MK3.9/MK3.5, and there is no need to switch to one or the other.

# [7. First run](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/7-first-run_512915)

- If is the Nozzle seal too low or too high, we need to reposition its height.

- Using a 2.5 mm Allen key:

- Turn the M3x30 screw clockwise to set the Nozzle seal lower.

- Turn the M3x30 screw counterclockwise to set the Nozzle seal higher.

- The correct position of the Nozzle seal is, that the Nozzle seal isn't bent and it is touching the nozzle.

# [3. Printer set up](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-printer-set-up_516385)

- Carefully turn the printer so that the side with the side filament sensor is facing you.

- Insert the first M4nEs nut into the front support extrusion (with the orange plastic cover). Insert the side with the spring (metal plate) first, then push the nut inside.

- Insert the second M4nEs nut into the extrusion.

- The M4nEs nuts are free to move, you can adjust the position as you want. But remember, the nut must be slightly pushed in to smoothly move. Anyway, we recommend approximately the same position as you can see in the picture.

Keep in mind that if you mount the Spool holder too high or too low, it may not fit the filament spool on it. There has to be enough space around it.

# [3. CoreXY & Back assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-corexy-back-assembly_521407)

-  **Are you left or right-handed?** The printer should be already laying on its left side from the previous chapter. If you are a left-hander rotate it carefully on the opposite right side (see the picture). We are going to attach the upper CoreXY part and tighten the screws to interconnect both parts together. The instructions are the same, **choose the side which suits you better for tightening the screws** _._

It is recommended to place a cardboard pad under the side of the base to protect the work bench and the frame from scratch.

- There's a hole in the extrusion that the pin has to fit into.

- Move the rear profile insert inside each extrusion of the CoreXY to the rear side of the assembly.

- Slide the remaining inserts approximately to the middle. Precise position will be addressed later.

- Rotate the CoreXY on its longer side and put it near the top of the four base extrusions.

- The rear profile inserts must be facing against the rear extrusions. Do not push the CoreXY all the way in until you are prompted.

# [5. Extruder & accessories assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-extruder-accessories-assembly_523539)

Reminder: To handle the printer,

**always grab the handles on both sides of the printer**

. Do not lift the printer by the aluminum extrusions or the metal sheet profiles on top.

In the following steps, we will work with tools and install extruder above the heatbed, it is recommended to protect it against any possible damage. An empty Prusament box can serve this purpouse.

- For better access to the X-carriager in the following steps, manually move the heatbed down.

- Attach the steel sheet by **first aligning the rear cutout** with the locking pins on the back of the heated bed. Hold the sheet by the front two cutouts and
slowly lay it down onto the heated bed - **watch your fingers!**

- Place the empty cardboard box approximately to the front center part of the heatbed.

- Move the X-axis assembly all the way to the front side of the printer.

- Move the X-carriage approximately to the center of the X-axis.

# [2. Frame assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/2-frame-assembly_529745)

- Peel off the white protective film from the thermal pad 25x25x1.2 mm on the Y motor.

The side with the white film is more adhesive. If you have a thermal pad with a blue protective film on both sides, the side doesn't matter.

- Stick the thermal pad on the Y motor and **peel off the second protective layer** from it.

The surface to which the pad is stuck must be cleaned of grease. This will ensure better adhesion.

- Place the Y-motor-holder onto the inner side of the rear plate of the frame.

- Ensure the correct orientation. The pulley must be facing towards the PSU.

- Attach the Y-motor-holder by using two M3x10 screws.

- To keep the Y motor cable safe during the assembly, temporarily hide it in the extrusion on the xBuddy box side.

---

# [3. X-axis & X-carriage assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-x-axis-x-carriage-assembly_529754)

- Turn the tube and applicator counterclockwise until you feel a slight resistance. This means that the holes in the applicator are aligned with the ball rows.

- Gently press the tube to push the lubricant into the ball rows of the bearing.

- Remove the bearing from the applicator and look at the amount applied inside. Take a look at the third picture, which shows a sufficient amount of lubricant inside the bearing.

The

**grease** **must be spread evenly over all four ball rows**

inside the bearing.

**There must not be too much grease**

, a thin layer is enough. Take a closer look at the last picture.

-  **Proceed the same from the opposite side of the bearing. The lubricant in the LM10LUU bearing must be applied along its entire length.**

- Wipe off excess grease on the outside of the bearing with a paper towel.

- Use this procedure for both LM10LUU bearings.

---

# [4. Z-axis assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-z-axis-assembly_529764)

- Place the Z-top-left on the rods and align it with the frame, and align the holes in the plastic parts with the holes in the frame.

- Use two M3x10 screws to attach the Z-top-left.

**Don't use excessive force during tightening.**

In case of increased resistance, try to run the screws in from the other side of the frame first to "clean up" the threaded hole. Then return to the front side.

Tip: move the X-axis a few centimeters down for make some space if you can't reach the screw behind the rod.

- Repeat this step on the other side of the frame with Z-top-right printed part.

- Rotate both threaded rods in parallel to move the X-axis assembly a few centimeters higher to release the X-holder.

- Remove the X-holder from the printer.

---

# [5. Nextruder assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-nextruder-assembly_529772)

In this step, we will finish tensioning the belt. Please read the instructions first, your belt might have proper tension already, then there is no need for additional screw adjustment.

- First, slightly release all the screws holding the motor, otherwise, the "tensioner" won't work (the motor must be able to move).

- Using ball-end Allen key start tightening the screw on the rear side of the X-end-motor, but after each turn or two check the tension in the belt.

- For the optimal performance, the belt must be a bit harder to press with your fingers. Move the extruder all the way to the X-end-idler and try the belt tension in the middle of the X-axis.

- When you achieve optimal tension, please tighten the screws again.

---

# [6. xLCD assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-xlcd-assembly_529780)

- Using the 3/32 PT screw, attach the power panic extended cable connector to the last (right) power terminal slot. **Do not completely tighten the terminal screw!** A few turns are enough for now, we will fully tighten the screw later.

The cable must be free to move.

- Connect the white connector of the power panic extended cable to the slot labeled PWR PAN. on the xBuddy board.

- Leave the black connector of the power panic extended cable free for now.

Note that most of the following steps are taken with a black PSU and without power panic extended cable. However, specific instructions will be provided if there are differences for the silver PSU.

- Pre-screw three 3/32 PT screws into the terminals on the xBuddy board. **Do not tighten the screws completely** , 3-5 turns will be sufficient.

---

# [7. Y-carriage & Heatbed assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/7-y-carriage-heatbed-assembly_529796)

- Attach two bearing clips on the remaining two bearing pockets and push two bearings inside.

- From the opposite side, secure each screw with the M3nN nut. **Do not tighten the nuts** , 1-2 turns are enough for now.

- Orient both bearings so that the two rows of bearing balls have to be on the sides.

- Unlike the previous bearing, position the bearings as close to the center of the Y-carriage as possible. **Beware, the bearings must not touch the edge of the pocket!**

**Correct bearing alignment is CRUCIAL**

. Proceed carefully and make sure that

**both bearings are as close to the center of the Y-carriage**

as possible and

**do not touch any pocket edge**

.

-  **Maintain the bearing's position** and slightly tighten the screws. Just barely to maintain the position and orientation of the bearings. We will tighten the screws firmly later on.

- Using the 2.5mm Allen key and the universal wrench, slightly tighten the M3nN nuts. **Do not tighten it completely** , just secure the bearing orientation and position. We will completely tighten it later.

# [1c. Parts preparation](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1c-parts-preparation_534120)

- After you have removed the thermistor and the tapes, clean the entire board to remove any grease. You can leave the glue, which was under the aluminum tape.

- Place the thermistor on the heatbed. **The tip of the thermistor must be in the circle.**

**If you miss this spot, the printer will read incorrect temperature values.**

Note which side the sensor is attached to the heatbed.

- Take the silver aluminium tape and carefully peel off the protective film.

- Glue the tape to the heatbed, **BUT ONLY** in the centre of the thermistor (inside the circle shape). We need to double-check the correct position.

- Peel or bend the tape slightly, to reveal the tip of the thermistor.

---

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_535146)

- 3D printed parts are very precise, however, there still might be a tolerance in the printed part and same goes for the size of the nut.

- Therefore it might happen, that the nut won't fit easily in or might be falling out. Let's see, how to fix it:

-  **Nut won't fit in** : use a screw with a thread along its entire length (typically: M3x10, M3x18) and screw it from the opposite side of the opening. While tightening the screw, the nut will be pulled in. Remove the screw afterwards.

-  **Alternative option** : you can use X-holder tool included in the package. Insert any screw (typically: M3x10 or M3x18) and screw the nut fully on the tip of the thread. Push the nut into the printed part and remove the screw with X-holder.

-  **Nut keeps falling out** : Use a piece of tape to fix the nut temporarily in place, as soon as you insert the screw in, you can remove the tape. Using glue isn't recommended as it can partly reach into the thread and you won't be able to tighten the screw properly.

- Every time we recommend using the "screw pulling technique", you will be reminded with Joe's avatar ;)

Parts in the pictures are used as an example.

# [3. X-axis & X-carriage assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-x-axis-x-carriage-assembly_593147)

- Turn the tube and applicator counterclockwise until you feel a slight resistance. This means that the holes in the applicator are aligned with the ball rows.

- Gently press the tube to push the lubricant into the ball rows of the bearing.

- Remove the bearing from the applicator and look at the amount applied inside. Take a look at the third picture, which shows a sufficient amount of lubricant inside the bearing.

The

**grease** **must be spread evenly over all four ball rows**

inside the bearing.

**There must not be too much grease**

, a thin layer is enough. Take a closer look at the last picture.

-  **Proceed the same from the opposite side of the bearing. The lubricant in the LM10LUU bearing must be applied along its entire length.**

- Wipe off excess grease on the outside of the bearing with a paper towel.

- Use this procedure for both LM10LUU bearings.

- First, slightly release all the screws holding the motor, otherwise, the "tensioner" won't work (the motor must be able to move).

- Using ball-end Allen key start tightening the screw on the rear side of the X-end-motor, but after each turn or two check the tension in the belt.

- For the optimal performance, the belt must be a bit harder to press with your fingers. Move the extruder all the way to the X-end-idler and try the belt tension in the middle of the X-axis.

- When you achieve optimal tension, please tighten the screws again.

- Orient both bearings so that the two rows of bearing balls have to be on the sides.

- Unlike the previous bearing, position the bearings as close to the center of the Y-carriage as possible. **Beware, the bearings must not touch the edge of the pocket!**

**Correct bearing alignment is CRUCIAL**

. Proceed carefully and make sure that

**both bearings are as close to the center of the Y-carriage**

as possible and

**do not touch any pocket edge**

.

-  **Maintain the bearing's position** and slightly tighten the screws. Just barely to maintain the position and orientation of the bearings. We will tighten the screws firmly later on.

# [1. Introduction](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/1-introduction_617206)

- 3D printed parts are very precise, however, there still might be a tolerance in the printed part and same goes for the size of the nut.

- Therefore it might happen, that the nut won't fit easily in or might be falling out. Let's see, how to fix it:

-  **Nut won't fit in** : use a screw with a thread along its entire length (typically: M3x10, M3x18) and screw it from the opposite side of the opening. While tightening the screw, the nut will be pulled in. Remove the screw afterwards.

-  **Alternative option** : you can use X-holder tool included in the package. Insert any screw (typically: M3x10 or M3x18) and screw the nut fully on the tip of the thread. Push the nut into the printed part and remove the screw with X-holder.

-  **Nut keeps falling out** : Use a piece of tape to fix the nut temporarily in place, as soon as you insert the screw in, you can remove the tape. Using glue isn't recommended as it can partly reach into the thread and you won't be able to tighten the screw properly.

- Every time we recommend using the "screw pulling technique", you will be reminded with Joe's avatar ;)

Parts in the pictures are used as an example.

# [3. Printer dissasembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/3-printer-dissasembly_617215)

- Take a look from the back of the printer.

- On the electronics box (Einsy base), release the middle screw on the box to open the door.

- Release all M3 screws on the cable holders on the box.

**Avoid cutting the cables!!!**

- If some of the cables are secure with zip ties, **carefully cut the zip ties**.

- Disconnect all cables from the EINSY electronics board.

- Some of the cables have a safety latch on the connector. Press the latch before disconnecting.

- Using the Philips screwdriver, loosen all the 6 power terminal screws and slide out all the power cables.

---

# [4. xBuddy assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/4-xbuddy-assembly_617223)

- Turn the printer so that the **extrusion profiles with shorter lengths are facing towards you**.

Most of the following pictures are taken on the latest version of the printer frame. The frame has hexagonal recesses on its back side. This is just a design element. The latest frame design is functionally identical with the previous ones.

- Insert four M3x6 screws to the back of the frame (side with shorter extrusions), so they resemble a rectangular pattern. Tighten the screws fully into the frame to clean the threads. Then loosen the screws, **leaving a gap of at least 3 mm between the screw head and the frame.**

**Make sure you are using the correct holes.**

- Insert two M3x10 screws into the M3nE nuts in the second short extrusion. Turn them only 3-4 times by using a 2.5mm Allen key, just for the screws to be kept in place.

---

# [5. xLCD & PSU assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/5-xlcd-psu-assembly_617231)

- Using the 3/32 PT screw, attach the power panic extended cable connector to the last (right) power terminal slot. **Do not completely tighten the terminal screw!** A few turns are enough for now, we will fully tighten the screw later.

The cable must be free to move.

- Connect the white connector of the power panic extended cable to the slot labeled PWR PAN. on the xBuddy board.

- Leave the black connector of the power panic extended cable free for now.

Note that most of the following steps are taken with a black PSU and without power panic extended cable. However, specific instructions will be provided if there are differences for the silver PSU.

- Pre-screw three 3/32 PT screws into the terminals on the xBuddy board. **Do not tighten the screws completely** , 3-5 turns will be sufficient.

---

# [6. Heatbed upgrade](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-heatbed-upgrade_617239)

- After you have removed the thermistor and the tapes, clean the entire board to remove any grease. You can leave the glue, which was under the aluminum tape.

- Place the thermistor on the heatbed. **The tip of the thermistor must be in the circle.**

**If you miss this spot, the printer will read incorrect temperature values.**

Note which side the sensor is attached to the heatbed.

- Take the silver aluminium tape and carefully peel off the protective film.

- Glue the tape to the heatbed, **BUT ONLY** in the centre of the thermistor (inside the circle shape). We need to double-check the correct position.

- Peel or bend the tape slightly, to reveal the tip of the thermistor.

---

# [7. Extruder upgrade](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/7-extruder-upgrade_617247)

- Open one end of the textile sleeve and slide it on the cable bundle leading from the extruder. **Don't forget to include the black nylon filament inserted earlier!**

- The length of the first wrap should be slightly longer than the cable-holder part, about 5 cm is enough.

- Take 3 zip ties and insert them into the lower row of holes on the cable-holder.

- Slightly twist the textile sleeve around the cable bundle.

- Secure the cable bundle by tightening the three zip ties.

**IMPORTANT**

: Cut the remaining part of each zip tie using pliers as closest to its head as possible. Note the correct position of each zip ties's head (slightly off-centre to the left).

- Include the hotend cables to the cable bundle and wrap it into the textile sleeve.

# [How to replace a Z-axis linear rail (XL)](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-z-axis-linear-rail-xl_623886)

Follow this procedure if you are replacing the Z-axis linear rail on the left side of the printer.

Do not over-tighten the screws on this step, there is a risk of stripping them.

Avoid damaging the modular bed tile cables during the procedure.

- Insert the centering tool between a pair of M3x8 screws. Start with pair 1. Tighten the two screws next to the centering tool slightly, using the long side of the 2.5mm Allen key.

- Repeat this procedure for the other screws, apart from the one closest to the heatbed assembly.

- If the carriage is in the way during either of these steps, carefully slide it to have enough space for the procedure.

- Once you get to pair 4, remove the indicated green protection pin and continue with the procedure.

# [Buddy firmware-specific G-code commands](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/buddy-firmware-specific-g-code-commands_633112)

This is a list of currently implemented G-Codes in [Prusa Buddy firmware ](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy)for MINI/MINI+/XL/MK4 printers. The description is available only for Prusa Research-specific G-codes or the ones having a specific implementation.
Since, Prusa Buddy firmware uses a fork of Marlin 2 firmware, the generic G-codes should be Marlin-compatible and their description can be found in [Marlin documentation](https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/) or on [RepRap Wiki.](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code)

### G-codes

First layer calibration, must be run within selftest only.

Performs the precise homing. (with no MBL, even without the stadard W parameter)

G28 issued without parameters homes the MMU3 as well. (invalidates the homing flags of Selector and Idler. These will perform homing async once it is considered safe, i.e. no filament in the selector)

* X, Y, Z: home the individual axes.
* C: home Z-axis only
* P: just invalidate the selector's homing validity flag
* I: just invalidate the idler's homing validity flag



Invalidates previous bed mesh measurements and starts the Mesh Bed Leveling (MBL).

#### G54_59 - Select a new workspace

(For iX printers only)
A workspace is an XYZ offset to the machine native space. All workspaces default to 0,0,0 at start, or with EEPROM support they may be restored from a previous session.
G92 is used to set the current workspace's offset.

#### G64 - Measure Z-Axis height

Measure the Z length and saves the max_z_pos into EEPROM. Then, it shows the results on the serial line.

G64 : Measure the Z length, save the measurement, show results on the serial line.

G64 D0.2 : Execute the G64 command but add extra 0.2 to the measurement.

#### G65 - Advanced homing/part measurement

(For iX printers only)
Homing to any endstop. Supports separate home positions in CNC workspaces(G54-G59.3)(enabled by defining CNC_COORDINATE_SYSTEMS in advanced config) Only supports homing of one axis at a time

Use: G65 [AXIS][ENDSTOP] D[DIRECTION][DISTANCE] [AXIS] Axis to home(X, Y, Z, E) [ENDSTOP] Target endstop number. [DIRECTION] Direction of homing '+' for positive or '-' for negative direction [DISTANCE] Distance to travel. If endstop is not reached within this distance, motion will stop and position will not be updated to endstop position.

For MK4 printer with MK3 G-code reverse compatibility.
Performs the Mesh Bed Leveling as with the G29.

#### G162 - Calibrate Z

* Z: Calibrate Z.
With no parameters, no action is performed.



G162 Z : Level the Z-Axis.

#### G163 - Measure length of axis

* X, Y: Set an axis to measure the length on.
* S<value>: Set sensitivity.
* P<value>: Set measurement period.



Automatic calibration with calibration object. Toolhead offset / Backlash calibration

### M-codes

Display a message in the host console

#### M120 - Enable endstops

#### M121 - Disable endstops

Report driver configuration and status.

Print fan speed on serial port.

#### M125 - Store current position and move to parking position.

Called on pause (by M25) to prevent material leaking onto the object. On resume (M24) the head will be moved back and the print will resume.
When not actively SD printing, M125 simply moves to the park position and waits, resuming with a button click or M108. Without PARK_HEAD_ON_PAUSE, the M125 command does nothing.

* L: override retract length
* X: override X
* Y: override Y
* Z: override Z raise



Set target heatbreak cooling temperature.

# [Binary G-code](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/binary-g-code_646763)

Binary G-code is a new standard for encoding and compressing ASCII G-code files. G-code files are easy to read and interpret, but their downside is that the data is not saved efficiently, and the file size is often very large. Compression of the file is problematic because the printers usually run on limited hardware and they may not have enough memory and/or CPU power to decompress it.

### Binary G-code

The binary G-code format is flexible and the encoding and compression of individual blocks is variable. We also provide [libbgcode](https://github.com/prusa3d/libbgcode) library which contains the routines to convert ASCII G-codes to binary and vice versa. The library is written in C++ and the repository includes bindings for Python.

Our testing shows that using binary G-code reduces the average size by about 70%.

### Slicer requirements

The support for the .bgcode file format is implemented in PrusaSlicer, including its export, loading configs, and previewing G-code or file associations. Exporting binary G-code can be enabled in Pri _nter Settings- >General->Support binary G-code_. This option is enabled by default starting from PrusaSlicer version [2.7.0](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/). An option to convert ASCII G-code to binary (or the opposite) has been added to the File menu.

### Disabling binary G-code export for all profiles

You can disable the use of binary G-code even globally for all profiles in the Preferences - Other - Use binary G-code when the printer supports it.

### Firmware requirements

To print a binary G-code, it has to be supported by the firmware of the printer. For Original Prusa MINI, MK4, and XL printers, it is supported starting from firmware [5.1.0](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/). It is necessary to update the [printer firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads) before using the binary G-code format.

### Compatibility issues

Some external printer control programs like Octoprint might have an issue with the binary G-code. In this case, disable the binary G-code feature in PrusaSlicer.

### What happened?

The Original Prusa MK4, MK3.9, and MK3.5 are equipped with the xBuddy board. Thanks to this, and the capability for firmware to check for the connected components, the printer can detect a firmware installed for the wrong printer version.

In case the printer recognizes a wrong firmware version is installed, it shows the message " **To continue, please insert the bundled USB flash drive and install the MK4/MK3.9/MK3.5 firmware** ", with just the detected printer model shown in the message.

Error name: Different FW Required

Error code: #13701 (MK4) #21701 (MK3.9) #23701 (MK3.5)

### How to fix it?

Download the firmware, and ensure the version is compatible with your printer model.

Transfer the firmware file to your USB drive. Make sure to unmount the drive from your operating system before physically removing it. Then, follow the procedure for firmware flashing.

# [Cancel Object (MK4, MK3.9, XL, MINI/+)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cancel-object-mk4-mk3-9-xl-mini_648856)

When printing multiple objects within the same print, it is possible that one or more objects might not have an optimal finish or get loose from the plate, while at the same time, other objects in the same print are printing perfectly.

The **Cancel Object** function makes it possible to stop printing an object directly from the printer menu, while the print is in progress.

The feature is available starting from PrusaSlicer 2.7.0, combined with Firmware 5.1.0 or above for Original Prusa MK4 and Original Prusa XL and Firmware 5.1.2 or above for Original Prusa MINI/+.

During a running print, navigate to _Tune menu - > Cancel Object_ and select an object that you wish to stop printing. The print will continue running, though any Gcode commands related to the canceled object will be ignored.

The easiest way to stop printing an object is to use the _Cancel Current_ function, located in the same submenu. Once the nozzle reaches the object you want to cancel, you can select this option.

It is also possible to resume the printing of a canceled object through the same submenu.

# [Printing without purge tower on the XL (Multi-Tool)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/printing-without-purge-tower-on-the-xl-multi-tool_649633)

The Original Prusa XL can print true multi-material prints without the need for any purge or wipe tower.

The purge tower is turned **ON** by default (when you are mixing materials or colors) because it's the best way to cover a wide range of materials and to ensure maximum reliability when using our default profiles.

However, under certain circmunstances, you can turn it off and still get perfect prints. The main factor is the filament quality and especially **how dry the material** **is**. The moisture in the filament is the main cause for the filament leaking out of the pre-heated nozzle during travel moves and when the tool is parked. It also greatly affects stringing.

If you want to try printing without the purge tower, make sure your filament is dry and check on the print regularly.

You can learn about hot to properly dry filament in [our guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/drying-filament_332086).

###

### How to turn off the Purge tower

Go to the **Print settings - Multiple Extruders - Wipe Tower** and untick the Enable checkbox.

- After you have removed the thermistor and the tapes, clean the entire board to remove any grease. You can leave the glue, which was under the aluminum tape.

- Place the thermistor onto the heatbed. **The tip of the thermistor must be in the circle.**

**If you miss this spot, the printer will read incorrect temperature values.**

Note which side the sensor is attached to the heatbed.

- Take the silver aluminium tape and carefully peel off the protective film.

- Glue the tape to the heatbed, **BUT ONLY** in the centre of the thermistor (inside the circle shape). We need to double-check the correct position.

# [Camera compatibility (RPi + PrusaLink)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/camera-compatibility-rpi-prusalink_654918)

PrusaLink for Original Prusa **MK2.5/S or MK3/S/+** printers is powered by an Raspberry Pi (RPi) board. A camera can be connected to it either using CSI or USB connection.

Alternatively, the same camera setup is also compatible with [RPi + Octoprint](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/octoprint-setup-on-mk4-mk3-9-mk3-5-xl_646395) on **MK4 / MK3.9 / XL** printers. Note that PrusaLink itself running on **MK3.9, MK4** and **XL** printers doesn’t support any cameras. You can use **Prusa Connect** , where it is possible to assign a camera to any of the supported Original Prusa printers.

###

### Compatible RPi cameras connected via CSI (MIPI):

All the official RPi cameras in the list below have been tested and are compatible. PrusaLink uses a "[whitelist](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Link/blob/master/prusa/link/cameras/picamera_driver.py#L48)" for CSI cameras. For example, if you connect RPi camera 3, it identifies to the RPi as "imx708" (according to the actual camera sensor it uses). The Wide-angle variant of the same camera identifies as "imx708_wide". If you use a camera that would identify differently than any of the whitelisted ones, it won’t show up in PrusaLink.

There are also other compatible cameras than the ones listed below, such as some Arducam models. However, we haven’t tested them and can’t guarantee they will work as expected or will not cause any issues.

If your CSI camera doesn’t seem to work - and you are an experienced user, you can [connect to PrusaLink using SSH](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-connect-to-rpi-via-ssh_658030), or connect a keyboard + monitor to the RPi and use the following command to find out if the camera is detected and what it identifies as:


libcamera-hello --list-cameras

Note that due to limited computing capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Zero, the resolution might be limited to 1920px in both axes on this RPi model.

Do not connect the cameras while the PrusaLink is running. Turn off the printer or disconnect the power before you connect the camera.

# [Connect Registration Failed](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/connect-registration-failed_654926)

### What happened?

During the configuration of **Prusa Connect** on the **Original Prusa MINI/+** , **MK4** , **MK3.9, MK3.5** or **XL** an error on this configuration can occur and the printer shows the message " **Registration to Prusa Connect failed due to: ~** ". In place of **~** , a text with more details is shown, from the list below. Depending on the specific shown text, there are different causes and fixes.

Error name: Connect Registration Failed

Error code: #12401 (MINI), #13401 (MK4), #21401 (MK3.9), #23401 (MK3.5), #17401 (XL)

#### DNS error

The printer wasn't able to resolve the **hostname** of the Prusa Connect server into an IP address. The hostname is a unique label assigned to a device connected to a network.

* The printer is not connected to the network at all.
* In case of a **static** configuration (non-DHCP), the **DNS server** is not configured or configured incorrectly.
* The local DNS server is currently not working.
* The Connect hostname is reconfigured to some that doesn't exist. For example, this can occur if loading a .ini file with an invalid configuration.



#### Refused

It's not possible to reach the server on the network level, hence it is not possible to establish a TCP connection. The system is either not answering at all or actively refuses the connection.

* The internet connection is not working, or a firewall blocks the communication.
* In the case of a **static** configuration (non-DHCP), the **gateway** (typically, this is the IP address of the router) is not configured or configured incorrectly.
* The Connect server is under maintenance.
* Too many TCP connections are open with the printer, for example in PrusaLink.



#### TLS error

This message points to an error doing a **SSL/TLS handshake**. This handshake is the process to create a safe and encrypted connection.

* Time is not synchronized on the printer (MINI/+). The time synchronization occurs for each internet connection, through the [NTP server](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ntp-server-mini_151132). It is possible this might take more time than initially expected, or rarely, that there might be issues with the server.
* A restrictive firewall (for example but not limited to a corporate proxy firewall) may restrict an automatic access to the NTP server. In that case, it will be necessary to manually allow the printer to access the NTP server.
* Something in the path is trying to tamper with the communication, for example but not limited to an attack.



#### Unauthorized

The server claims that the printer is not authorized. The printer is not recognized as an Original Prusa.

#### Server error

The server is returning a **500 Internal Server Error** or similar. The issue is on the Connect side, and is expected to be fixed on its own.

#### Internal error

This error is caused by an issue related to the printer firmware.

#### Network error

Similar to the Refused error, but the connection dropped after it was initialized.

* Glitchy internet connection.
* The **latency** to the Connect servers is too high. A geographic location is very far from our Connect servers can contribute to this cause.
* The Connect server is temporarily down.



#### Protocol error

The response from the server is not recognized.

* Bug on the server side. This cause is on our side and expected to be fixed on its own.
* Too old firmware on the printer and it's no longer supported.
* A misconfiguration from the **.ini file** loaded on the printer, connecting to something different than our Connect server.



### How to fix it?

#### DNS error, Refused

Ensure that the printer is connected to the internet. In case of a static (non-DHCP) connection, ensure the correct settings are there, or test a DHCP connection. Also, check the .ini configuration file, and in case, rewrite the file.

If the previous steps didn't fix the issue, attempt a [factory reset](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/factory-reset-mini_177516).

#### TLS error

Reattempt the Connect registration, after the printer is connected to the internet for a few more minutes.

If the previous step didn't fix the issue, double-check your network **firewall**. Some firewalls will need for the NTP server to be allowed manually. The specific steps will depend on your specific firewall, we recommend checking your firewall documentation.

#### Unauthorized

If your printer is not an Original Prusa printer, it cannot use our Prusa Connect service.

In case your printer is an Original Prusa, [ re-flash or update its firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-mini-mini_124784).

#### Server error

A server error indicates an issue from our side. The issue will be fixed on its own, try registering again to Prusa Connect later.

#### Internal error

[Re-flash or update the printer firmware](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/firmware-updating-mini-mini_124784). If this does not solve the issue, take note if the printer might have other issues, even if not directly related.

#### Network error

Ensure that your internet connection is stable and not glitchy. To confirm whether an inconsistent internet connection caused the issue, test another connection, if available, such as a hotspot from your mobile phone.

#### Protocol error

Ensure that the printer is running our latest firmware version. If it is running an old version, update the firmware. Also, check the .ini configuration file, and in case, rewrite the file.

# [Hotend preheat error #23202 (MK3.5)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/hotend-preheat-error-23202-mk3-5_655030)

### What happened?

The printer is showing the message " **Hotend preheat error: Check the print head heater and thermistor wiring for potential damage** "

Error name: Hotend preheat error

This error is shown when the printer is unable to heat up the nozzle more than **2 ºC for 20 seconds**. The printer starts a safety feature, which instantly kills the heating process and displays the message on the screen. The printer then waits for the user to inspect all parts and if needed fix the issue.

### How to fix it?

1. Make sure that the **ambient temperature** where the printer is stable, and above **10 ºC**.
2. Make sure the thermistor and heater are properly plugged into the electronics board. You can double-check that by following this guide: (link from assembly guide)
3. Check if the [fuses](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk4_411666) are not blown.
4. Make sure that your [hotend assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbreak-heatsink-heaterblock-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_16104#17312) is correct.



If the issue persists, the error likely stemmed from an issue with the hotend heater or hotend thermistor. To find out which one of these two is malfunctioning, perform the test described below.

You can also verify if the thermistor or heater is damaged using a

[multimeter](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/multimeter-usage_2117)

.

Use a hairdryer to blow hot air towards the hotend. In the meantime, check if there is any temperature change on the LCD screen.

* If there is a positive temperature change it means that the hotend thermistor is working and detecting the temperature change. Most likely, the issue stems from the hotend heater.
* If there is no change at all, most likely the hotend thermistor is causing the issue, or at least contributing to it.

### What happened?

The printer is showing the message " **Hotend thermal runaway: Check the print head thermistor wiring for possible damage.** "

Error name: Hotend thermal runaway

The error will show if the temperature on the nozzle drops by **12 ºC** for an extended period of time. This temperature drop would usually not be an issue, but if the heat is not recovered after **60 seconds** the error will happen. In this case, the printer will stop the heating and display the message on the screen.

### How to fix it?

1. Make sure that the **ambient temperature** where the printer is stable, and above **10 ºC**.
2. Make sure that your [hotend assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbreak-heatsink-heaterblock-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mmu2s_16104) is correct, especially if there have been recent interventions or maintenance.
3. Visually check the thermistor if it is still securely and correctly installed in the heater block. The whole cartridge should be inside the block, with no part of it sticking out.

4. Check the fan shroud for any kind of damage, and verify its position. A damaged or tilted shroud can change the airflow and start cooling the heater block directly.
5. Make sure the thermistor and heater are properly plugged into the electronics board. You can double-check that by following this guide: (link from assembly guide)
6. Check if the [fuses](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/blown-fuse-mk4_411666) are not blown.

# [How to connect to RPi via SSH](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-connect-to-rpi-via-ssh_658030)

This article is intended for experienced users only! During the regular RPi + PrusaLink operation, there should be no need to set up and use SSH.

Since we develop neither Raspberry Pi nor SSH functionality, we are only able to provide limited support on its use.

### What is SSH?

SSH is a way to remotely send command line commands to the Raspberry Pi over a secure connection. This enables the user to control their RPi without having it hooked up to a monitor and a keyboard. This article describes a process on an RPi board with PrusaLink installed.

To connect to the RPi board remotely, you will need a computer with a working SSH client, like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) but most operating systems usually have SSH already integrated into their terminal.

### How to enable SSH on the RPi with PrusaLink?

SSH can be enabled while setting up an SD card with PrusaLink image as described in the [Prusalink for MK3/S/+ guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/prusalink-and-prusa-connect-setup-mk3-s-_221744#222334). You have to also set a device username + password. Note these credentials are different than your PrusaLink credentials or the Prusa Account.

To enable SSH on RPi with PrusaLink already installed and running, you have to connect the microSD card into a PC or a MAC and put a file named "ssh" without a file extension into the boot partition of the SD card. (A typical raspi SD has two partitions, "boot" and "root", although only the "boot" is accessible from Windows and Mac operating systems. To access the "root" partition, you have to use Linux or another similar Unix-based operating system.
Once the file is on there, safely remove the SD, put it back into the RPi and boot it up. You can now connect to your RPi by typing "ssh jo@<IP_ADDRESS>" into the commandline (replace "<IP_ADDRESS>" for the RPi's ip address). The default password is "raspberry", same as on every RPi. Only the username has been changed from "pi" to "jo" on PrusaLink.

# [Homing Error Z #23301 (MK3.5)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/homing-error-z-23301-mk3-5_665017)

### What happened?

During calibration, mesh bed leveling, or before a print, it is crucial for the printer firmware to determine the print head and heatbed position. This is done through the **homing** process, where the print axes move to a known reference position, called **home**.

The MK3.5 firmware uses the **SuperPINDA** probe readings of their distance to the steel sheet. In case of an issue with the readings and the value difference between them, the printer will show the message " **Failed to home the extruder in Z-axis** ".

Error name: Homing Error Z

### How to fix it?

The error might indicate an issue with the SuperPINDA probe. Its cable can be damaged or disconnected. A mechanical issue on the Z-axis might also trigger this error.

#### Testing the SuperPINDA probe

Follow the steps in the following article: [PINDA/SuperPINDA testing](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/p-i-n-d-a-superpinda-sensor-testing_2091).

#### SuperPINDA visual inspection

Check that the SuperPINDA probe wires are not visibly broken. Also, ensure everything is connected to the xBuddy mainboard, inside its case. Loosen the four screws securing the cover, and open the cover to reveal the board.

Check that all the connectors are secure in their sockets. Though unlikely, rough shipping or handling could have shaken the SuperPINDA cables loose.

#### Z-axis movement

Ensure that the Z-axis can move smoothly. With the printer switched off, check the Z-axis and trapezoidal nut assembly:

Double-check the orientation of the trapezoid nuts, assembled on the Z-axis motor leadscrews. A section of their threads should be inside the printed part, not protruding up from the printed part. The highest point should be the M3 bolts securing the trapezoid nuts.

#### Extruder assembly

Ensure nothing is touching the printer components during the Z-axis range of movement, for example, zip ties from the cable bundles.

If the previous check did not solve the issue, check the [extruder and hotend assembly](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/failing-z-calibration-mk3s-mk2-5s_160858) from the linked dedicated guide.

# [Nozzle Heater Overcurrent #23308 (MK3.5)](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/nozzle-heater-overcurrent-23308-mk3-5_665025)

### What happened?

The Original Prusa MK3.5 is showing the message: " **Overcurrent detected on nozzle heater** ".

Error name: Nozzle Heater Overcurrent

Error code: #23308 (MK3.5)

The error is shown when there is a damaged cable on the hotend heater or any of its connections.

### How to fix it?

#### Visual check: hotend

The most likely cause of this issue is damage to the hotend heater cable. With the printer **cold and off** , check the path between the hotend heater and the hotend heater block, and see if there are any parts that are visibly broken or pinched, or if the positioning of the component appears wrong, or different than the below picture.

#### Visual check: extruder cable bundle

Check if there might be an overtightened zip tie on the hotend cable bundle, on the rear of the print head.

#### Visual check: xBuddy board

In case there is no damage, check the cable connection to the xBuddy board. Try reconnecting the connector.

In rare cases, this error message can be shown in case of damage to the xBuddy board. If the cables and connectors are intact, try checking the board for any damage.

The order of an Academy course is created in the same way used for physical products. Add the products to the cart, and select the number of licenses.

### Purchasing one license

In case you purchase one license for a course, the default setting is for it to assign it to your account. In case you wish to assign it to a different account, **you can uncheck the box**.

### Purchasing multiple licenses

In case you purchase multiple licenses of a course, all licenses are visible in the ' _my courses'_ section on your account. This is valid also in case you wish to assign one of the licenses to yourself.

## Assigning licenses

To assign your purchased licenses, log in to our e-shop and navigate to ' _my courses_ '. Then, scroll down to __ ' _licenses management_ '.

### Licenses management

There are two ways to assign licenses:

1. **Inserting and assigning each email separately**. This method is suitable for a low number of licenses.
2. **Importing a CSV file**. The CSV file should contain one email address per each line. This method is suitable for assigning a large amount of licenses.



In both cases, our system will check and validate the email format, and whether the account associated with the selected email address already owns the course.

The following functions are also available from the _licenses management_ section.

* You can see the assignment status, to verify if a license is assigned, or a request is still pending.
* Before the activation of a license, you can resend the activation email for each email or download the license assignment.
* You can check the number of available licenses.



### Licence status

### Batch import

## The license assignee does not have a Prusa Account

While a Prusa Account is required to access a course, there is no problem in assigning a course to an email address not associated with a Prusa Account.

The course assignment information and an invitation to create a Prusa Account are sent via email.

Once the Prusa Account is created, the course license is automatically assigned. It is possible to cancel a course assignment before the assignee starts the course.
